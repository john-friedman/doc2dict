<p align="center"><strong>PART I</strong></center></p>

<p align="left"><strong>Item 1.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="ref1">
<strong>Business</strong></a>.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">(a)&nbsp;<u>General Development
of Business</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;North European Oil Royalty Trust (the
"Trust") is a grantor trust which, on behalf of the owners of
beneficial interest in the Trust (the "unit owners"), holds overriding
royalty rights covering gas and oil production in certain concessions
or leases in the Federal Republic of Germany.  The rights are held
under contracts with local German exploration and development
subsidiaries of ExxonMobil Corp. ("ExxonMobil") and the Royal
Dutch/Shell Group of Companies ("Royal Dutch/Shell Group").  Under
these contracts, the Trust receives various percentage royalties on
the proceeds of the sales of certain products from the areas involved.
At the present time, royalties are received for sales of gas well
gas, oil well gas, crude oil, condensate and sulfur.  See Item 2 of
this Report for descriptions of the relationships of these companies
and certain of these contracts.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The royalty rights were
received by the Trust from North European Oil Company (the "Company")
upon dissolution of the Company in September 1975.  The Company was
organized in 1957 as the successor to North European Oil Corporation
(the "Corporation").  The Trust is administered by trustees (the
"Trustees") under an Agreement of Trust dated September 10, 1975, as
amended (the "Trust Agreement").</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">Neither the Trust nor the
Trustees on behalf of the Trust conduct any active business activities
or operations.  The function of the Trustees is to monitor, verify,
collect, hold, invest and distribute the royalty payments made to the
Trust.  Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustees make quarterly
distributions of the net funds received by the Trust on behalf of
the unit owners.  Funds temporarily held by the Trust prior to their
distribution are invested in an interest bearing money market account.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">There has been no significant
change in the principal operation or purpose of the Trust during the
past fiscal year. </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">As part of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 ("SOX"), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
adopted rules implementing legislation concerning governance matters
for publicly held entities.  The Trust is complying with the
requirements of the SEC and SOX and, at this time, the Trustees have
chosen not to request any relief from those provisions based on the
passive nature of the Trust but may do so in the future.  In that
connection, the Trustees have directed that certain of the additional
statements and disclosures set forth or incorporated by reference in
this Report, which the SEC requires of corporations, be made even
though some of such statements and disclosures might not now or in
the future be required to be made by the Trust.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">In addition, the New York
Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), where units of beneficial interest of
the Trust are listed for trading, has additional corporate governance
rules as set forth in Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual.
Most of the governance requirements promulgated by the NYSE are not
applicable to the Trust, which is a passive entity acting as a
royalty trust and holds only overriding royalty rights.  The Trustees
have, however, chosen to constitute an Audit Committee and a
Compensation Committee but may not necessarily continue to do so in
the future.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">(b)&nbsp;<u>Narrative
Description of Business</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Trust Agreement,
the Trust conducts no active business operations and is restricted
to collection of income from royalty rights and distribution to unit
owners of the net income after payment of administrative and
related expenses.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The overriding royalty
rights held by the Trust are derived from contracts and agreements
originally entered into by German subsidiaries of the predecessor
Corporation during the early 1930s.  The Trust's primary royalty
rights are based on a government granted concession and remain in
effect as long as there are continued production activities and/or
exploration efforts within the concession.  It is generally
anticipated that production activities will continue as long as
they remain economically profitable.  The Trust holds other royalty
rights, which are based on
leases which have passed their original expiration dates.  These
leases remain in effect as long as there is continued production or
the lessor does not cancel the lease.  Individual lessors will
normally not seek termination of the rights originally granted
because the leases provide for royalty payments to the lessors if
sales of oil or gas result from discoveries made on the leased
land.  Additionally, termination by individual lessors would result
in the escheat of mineral rights to the applicable state.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">Royalties are paid to the
Trust on sales from production under these leases and concessions on a
regular monthly or quarterly basis pursuant to the royalty agreements.
The Trust receives the royalty payments exclusively in Euros.  After
the royalties have been deposited in the Trust's account with
Deutsche Bank in Germany, sufficient funds are reserved to handle any
outstanding or anticipated expenses and maintain a minimal balance of
10,000 Euros.  The Trust then transfers the remainder of Euro
denominated funds into United States ("U.S.") dollars based upon the
available exchange rates.  Following this
conversion to U.S. dollars, the royalties are transferred
to the Trust's bank account in the U.S.  The Trust does not engage in
activities to hedge against currency risk, and the fluctuations in the
conversion rate impact its financial results.  Since the
actual royalty deposits are held as Euros for such a limited time, the
market risk with respect to these deposits is small.  The Trust has not
experienced any difficulty in effecting the conversion of Euros into
U.S. dollars.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">As the holder of overriding
royalty rights, the Trust has no legal ability, whether by contract or
operation of law, to compel production or exploration.  Moreover, if
an operator should determine to terminate production in any concession
or lease area and to surrender the concession or lease, the royalty
rights for that area would thereby be terminated.  Under certain
royalty agreements, it is a requirement that the Trust be advised of
any intention to surrender lease or concession rights.  While the
Trust itself is precluded from undertaking any production activities,
possible residual rights might permit the Trust to take up a
surrendered concession or lease and attempt to retain a third-party
operator to develop such concession or lease.  There is no assurance
that the Trust could find such a third party.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The exploration for and the
production of gas and oil is a speculative business.  The Trust has no
means of ensuring continued income from its royalty rights at either
their present levels or otherwise.  The Trust has no role in any of
the operating companies' decision-making processes, such as gas
pricing, gas sales or exploration, which can impact royalty income.
In addition, fluctuations in prices and supplies of gas and oil and
the effect these fluctuations might have on royalty income to the
Trust and on reserves net to the Trust cannot be accurately
projected.  Finally, natural gas and crude oil are wasting assets.
While known reserves may increase as additional development adds
quantities to the reserve amount, the amount of known and unknown
reserves is finite and will decline over time.  Given these factors,
along with the uncertainty in worldwide and local German economic
conditions and the fact that the Trustees have no information
beyond that information which is generally available to the public,
the Trustees make no projections regarding future royalty income.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">While Germany has laws
relating to environmental protection, the Trustees do not
have detailed information concerning the present or possible effect
of such laws on operations in areas where the Trust holds royalty
rights on production and sale of products from those areas.  The
Trustees were informed by the Trust's German consultant that on
July 8, 2016, a hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") law was passed in
Germany permitting fracking in sandstone at any depth.  The law
requires that an environmental impact study be performed and that
permission by the relevant water authority be granted in order to
ensure the protection of drinking water supplies.  Based upon an
analysis of the details of this law, the Trust's German consultant
has informed the Trust that fracking will be permitted in all
current productive zones within the Oldenburg concession (as
defined below) both due
to the depths involved and the nature of the productive zones.
However, the operating companies would still have to comply with
all regulatory requirements governing the use of fracking. The
failure by the operating companies to comply with all regulatory
requirements could affect the volume of gas, sulfur and oil
production by the operating companies and could adversely affect
the royalties paid to the Trust.  </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Trust, in cooperation
with a parallel royalty owner (Unitarian Universalist Congregation
at Shelter Rock)("UUCSR")), arranges for periodic examinations of
the books and records of the operating companies to verify
compliance with the computation provisions of the applicable
agreements.  As a cost savings measure, the royalty examination is
conducted on a biennial basis.  From time to time, these
examinations disclose computational errors or errors from
inappropriate application of existing agreements and appropriate
adjustments are requested to be made.  As a result of the
amendments to the Trust's royalty agreements which effect pricing
simplification (see Item 7 of this Report), examinations by the
Trust's German accountants have been simplified since these
examinations are primarily limited to the verification of the gas
quantities sold.  Although these periodic examinations may also
disclose other matters that are subject to dispute between the
parties, these disputes have historically been resolved through
negotiations without the need for litigation.  The Trust's
accountants in Germany began their examination of the operating
companies for calendar years 2019 and 2020 in November 2021 when the
final sales figures and the German Border Import gas Prices (see
Item 7 of this Report) were both available.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">(c)&nbsp;<u>Financial
Information about Geographic Areas</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Item 2 of this
Report, there is a schedule (by product, geographic area and
operating company) showing the royalty income received by the Trust
during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">(d)&nbsp;<u>Information
about our Trustees and
Executive Officers</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;As specified in the
Trust Agreement, the affairs of the Trust are managed by not more
than five individual Trustees who receive compensation determined
under that same agreement.  One of the Trustees is designated as
Managing Trustee.  Robert P. Adelman has served in a non-executive
capacity as Managing Trustee since November 1, 2006.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">Ahron H. Haspel is
independent and has been determined to be a financial expert (both
as defined in the SEC rules).  Mr. Haspel serves as Chairman for
the Audit and Compensation Committees.  Lawrence A. Kobrin serves
as Clerk to the Trustees (a role similar to that of a corporate
secretary).  For these services, these three individuals receive
additional compensation.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">Day-to-day matters are
handled by the Managing Director, John R. Van Kirk, who also serves
as CEO and CFO.  Mr. Van Kirk has held the position of
Managing Director of the Trust since November 1990.  As a cost
saving measure, the Trust shifted to a virtual office in fiscal
2019.  This shift has not impacted the operations or
administration of the Trust.  In addition to the Managing
Director, the Trust has one administrative employee in the U.S.,
whose title is Administrator.  The number of total employees of
the Trust is two, and the number of full-time employees is two.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Trust and UUCSR have
retained the services of a consultant, an accounting firm
and a legal firm in Germany.  The consultant has broad experience in
the petroleum industry and provides reports on a regular basis.  The
accounting firm and the legal firm advise and represent as needed.
The Trust and the co-royalty holder share the costs of these services
in Germany.</p>

<b>Properties</b>.</a></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The properties of the Trust,
which the Trust and Trustees hold pursuant to the Trust Agreement on
behalf of the unit owners, are overriding royalty rights on sales of
gas, sulfur and oil under a concession in the Federal Republic of
Germany (the "Oldenburg concession").  The Oldenburg concession covers
approximately 1,386,000 acres, is located in the German federal state
of Lower Saxony, and is the area from which natural gas, sulfur and oil
are extracted.  The Oldenburg concession currently provides nearly 100%
of all the royalties received by the Trust.  The Oldenburg concession
is held by Mobil Erdgas-Erdol GmbH ("Mobil Erdgas"), a German operating
subsidiary of ExxonMobil, and by Oldenburgische Erdolgesellschaft
("OEG").  As a result of direct and indirect ownership, ExxonMobil owns
two-thirds of OEG and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Companies owns
one-third of OEG.  BEB Erdgas und Erdol GmbH ("BEB"), a joint venture
in which ExxonMobil and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group each own 50%,
administers the concession held by OEG.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">In 2002, Mobil Erdgas and
BEB formed ExxonMobil Production Deutschland GmbH ("EMPG") to carry
out all exploration, drilling and production activities.  All sales
activities upon which the calculation of royalties is based are still
handled by either Mobil Erdgas or BEB (the "operating companies"). </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">Under one set of rights
covering the western part of the Oldenburg concession (approximately
662,000 acres), the Trust receives a royalty payment of 4% on gross
receipts from sales by Mobil Erdgas of gas well gas, oil well gas,
crude oil and condensate (the "Mobil Agreement").  Under the Mobil
Agreement there is no deduction of costs prior to the calculation of
royalties from gas well gas and oil well gas, which together account
for approximately 99% of all the royalties under said agreement.
Historically, the Trust has received significantly greater royalty
payments under the Mobil Agreement (as compared to the OEG Agreement
described below) due to the higher royalty rate specified by that
agreement.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Trust is also entitled
under an agreement with Mobil Erdgas to receive a 2% royalty on gross
receipts of sales of sulfur obtained as a by-product of sour gas
produced from the western part of Oldenburg (the "Mobil Sulfur
Agreement").  The payment of the sulfur royalty is conditioned upon
sales of sulfur by Mobil Erdgas at a selling price above an agreed upon
base price.  This base price is adjusted annually by an inflation index.
When the average quarterly selling price falls below the indexed base
price, no sulfur royalties are paid by Mobil Erdgas.  Sulfur royalties
under the Mobil Agreement totaled $178,367 and $71,280 during fiscal
2021 and 2020, respectively.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">Under another set of rights
covering the entire Oldenburg concession and pursuant to the agreement
with OEG, the Trust receives royalties at the rate of 0.6667% on gross
receipts from sales by BEB of gas well gas, oil well gas, crude oil,
condensate and sulfur (removed during the processing of sour gas) less
a certain allowed deduction of costs (the "OEG Agreement").  Under the
OEG Agreement, 50% of the field handling and treatment costs as
reported for state royalty purposes are deducted from the gross sales
receipts prior to the calculation of the royalty to be paid to the
Trust.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">Exhibit 99.1 to this Report
is a report entitled Calculation of Cost Depletion Percentage for
the 2021 Calendar Year Based on the Estimate of Remaining Proved
Producing Reserves in the Northwest Basin of the Federal Republic of
Germany as of October 1, 2021 (the "Cost Depletion Report").  The
Cost Depletion Report, dated November 23, 2021, was prepared by
Graves & Co. Consulting, LLC, 2777 Allen Parkway, Suite 525,
Houston, Texas 77019 ("Graves & Co.").  Graves & Co. is an
independent petroleum and natural gas consulting organization
specialized in analyzing hydrocarbon reserves.
</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Cost Depletion Report
provides documentation supporting the calculation of the cost
depletion percentage for the 2021 calendar year based on the use of
certain production data and the estimated net proved producing
reserves as of October 1, 2021 for the primary area in which the
Trust holds overriding royalty rights.  In order to permit timely
filing of the Cost Depletion Report and consistent with the practice
of the Trust in prior years, the information has been prepared for
the 12-month period ended September 30, 2021.  While this is one
month prior to the end of the fiscal year of the Trust, the
information available for production and sales through the end of
September is the most complete information available at a date
early enough to permit the timely preparation of the various
reports required.  Unit owners are referred to the full text of the
Cost Depletion Report contained herein for further details.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The cost depletion percentage
is prepared by Graves & Co. for the Trust's unit owners for tax
reporting purposes.  The cost depletion percentage in that report for
calendar 2021 is 17.7008%.  Specific details relative to the Trust's
income and expenses and cost depletion percentage as they apply to
the calculation of taxable income for the 2021 calendar year are
included on removable pages in the 2021 Annual Report.  Additionally,
the tax reporting information for 2021 is available on the Trust's
website, http://www.neort.com/tax-letters.html.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The primary purpose of the
Cost Depletion Report is the preparation of the cost depletion
percentage for use by unit owners in their own tax reporting.  The
only information provided to the Trust that can be utilized in the
calculation of the cost depletion percentage is current and
historical production and sales of proved producing reserves.  For
the western half of the Oldenburg concession, the Trust receives
quarterly production and sales information on a well-by-well basis.
For the eastern half of the Oldenburg concession, the Trust receives
cumulative quarterly production and sales information on two general
areas.  These general areas encompass numerous fields with varying
numbers of wells.  Pursuant to the arrangements under which the
Trust holds royalty rights and the fact that the Trust is not
considered an operating company within Germany, the Trust has no
access to the operating companies' proprietary information
concerning producing field reservoir data.  The Trustees have been
advised by their German counsel that publication of such information
is not required under applicable law in Germany and that the royalty
rights do not grant the Trust the right to require or compel the
release of such information.  Efforts to obtain such
information from the operating companies have not been successful.
The information made available to the Trust by the operating
companies does not include any of the following: reserve estimates,
capitalized costs, production cost estimates, revenue projections,
producing field reservoir data (including pressure data, permeability,
porosity and thickness of producing zone) or other similar
information.  While the limited information available to the Trust
permits the calculation of the cost depletion percentage, it does not
change the uncertainty with respect to the estimate of proved
producing reserves.  In addition, it is impossible for the Trust or
its consultant to make estimates of proved undeveloped or probable
future net recoverable oil and gas by appropriate geographic
areas.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Trust has the authority
to examine, but only for certain limited purposes, the operating
companies' sales and production from the royalty areas.  The Trust
also has access to published materials in Germany from W.E.G. (a
German organization equivalent to the American Petroleum Institute
or the American Gas Association).  The use of such statistical
information relating to production and sales necessarily involves
extrapolations and projections.  Both Graves & Co. and the Trustees
believe the use of the material available is appropriate and
suitable for preparation of the cost depletion percentage and the
estimates described in the Cost Depletion Report.  The Trustees and
Graves & Co. believe this report and these estimates to be reasonable
and appropriate but assume that these estimates may vary from
statistical estimates which could be made if reservoir production
information (of the kind normally available to producing companies
in the U.S.) were available.  The limited information
available makes it inappropriate to make projections or estimates
of proved or probable reserves of any category or class other than
the estimated net proved producing reserves described in the Cost
Depletion Report.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">Attachment A of the Cost
Depletion Report shows a schedule of estimated net proved producing
reserves of the Trust's royalty properties, computed as of
October 1, 2021 and a five-year schedule of gas, sulfur and oil
sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, 2020, 2019,
2018 and 2017 computed from quarterly sales reports of operating
companies received by the Trust during such periods.</p>

<p align="left"><u>Executive Summary</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">The Trust is a passive fixed
investment trust which holds overriding royalty rights, receives
income under those rights from certain operating companies, pays
its expenses and distributes the remaining net funds to its unit
owners.  As mandated by the Trust Agreement, distributions of income
are made on a quarterly basis.  These distributions, as determined
by the Trustees, constitute substantially all of the funds on hand
after provision is made for Trust expenses then anticipated.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">The Trust does not engage in
any business or extractive operations of any kind in the areas over
which it holds royalty rights and is precluded from engaging in such
activities by the Trust Agreement.  There are no requirements,
therefore, for capital resources with which to make capital
expenditures or investments in order to continue the receipt of
royalty revenues by the Trust.  </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">The properties of the Trust
are described in Item 2. Properties of this Report.  Of particular
importance with respect to royalty income are the two royalty
agreements, the Mobil Agreement and the OEG Agreement.  The Mobil
Agreement covers gas sales from the western part of the Oldenburg
concession. The Trust has traditionally received the majority of its
royalty income under the Mobil Agreement due to the higher
royalty rate of 4%.  The OEG Agreement covers gas sales from
the entire Oldenburg concession but the royalty rate of 0.6667% is
significantly lower and gas royalties have been correspondingly
lower.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">The operating companies pay
monthly royalties to the Trust based on their sales of natural gas,
sulfur and oil.  Of these three products, natural gas provided
approximately 90% of the total royalties in fiscal 2021.  The amount
of royalties paid to the Trust is primarily based on four factors:
the amount of gas sold, the price of that gas, the area from which
the gas is sold and the exchange rate.  For purposes of the royalty
calculations, the determination of the gas price is explained in
detail in the following three paragraphs.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">On August 26, 2016, the
Mobil and OEG Agreements were amended to establish a new base to
determine gas prices for the calculation of the Trust's royalties
calculated.  This new base is set as the state assessment base for
natural gas used by the operating companies in their calculation
of royalties payable to the State of Lower Saxony.  This change
reflects a shift from the use of gas ex-field prices ("contractual
prices") to the prices calculated for the German Border Import gas
Price ("GBIP").  The average combined totals of the GBIP for the
relevant three-month period are used to provide an average gas
price for the quarter.  This average gas price is increased by 1%
and 3% per the terms of the Mobil and OEG Royalty Agreements and
is used by the operators to calculate the royalties payable to the
Trust for a given quarter.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">The change to the GBIP was
intended to be revenue neutral for the Trust in comparison to the
previous pricing methodology.  Additionally, this change was intended
to reduce the scope and cost of the accounting examination, eliminate
ongoing disputes with OEG and Mobil regarding sales to related parties,
and reduce prior year adjustments to the normally scheduled year-end
reconciliation.  The pricing basis has eliminated certain costs
(transportation and plant gas storage) that were previously deductible
prior to the royalty calculation under the OEG Agreement.  </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">On approximately the 25th of
the months of January, April, July and October, the operating companies
calculate the volume of gas sold during the previous calendar
quarter.  This volume of gas sold is then multiplied by the average
adjusted GBIP available at that time.  Due to delays in the calculation
of the GBIP by the state, the most current GBIP is from a period
ending two months prior to the end of the relevant calendar quarter.
The respective royalty amount is divided into thirds and forms the
monthly royalty payments to the Trust (payable on the 15th of each
month) for the Trust's upcoming fiscal quarter.  At the same time that
the operating companies determine the actual amount of royalties that
were payable for the prior calendar quarter, they look at the actual
amount of royalties that were paid to the Trust for that period and
calculate the difference between what was paid and what was payable.
Any positive adjustments are paid immediately and any negative
adjustments would be deducted from the royalty payment for the first
month of the next fiscal quarter.  In September of the succeeding
calendar year, the operating companies make the final determination
of any necessary royalty adjustments for the prior calendar year with
a positive or negative adjustment made accordingly.  These adjustments
are based on the final average GBIP for the preceding year applied to
the final calculation of the total volume of gas sold by the
operating companies during that year.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">There are two types of
natural gas found within the Oldenburg concession, sweet gas and
sour gas.  Sweet gas has little or no contaminants and needs no
treatment before it can be sold.  Sour gas, in comparison, must be
processed at the Grossenkneten desulfurization plant before it can
be sold.  The desulfurization process removes hydrogen sulfide and
other contaminants.  The hydrogen sulfide in gaseous form is
converted to sulfur in a solid form, which is sold separately.  With
full operation of the two units, raw gas input capacity stands at
approximately 400 million cubic feet ("MMcf") per day.  As needed,
EMPG conducts maintenance on the plant generally during the summer
months when demand is lower.  As part of the regular 10-year
scheduled maintenance, Grossenkneten underwent an overhaul from
September 8, 2020 through October 13, 2020.  During this time the
plant was completely shut down and no sour gas was processed.
Since sour gas accounts for 75% of overall gas sales and 98% of
western gas sales, this shutdown significantly impacted royalty
income during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and the first
quarter of fiscal 2021.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">For unit owners, changes in
the U.S. dollar value of the Euro have an immediate impact.  This
impact occurs at the time the royalties, which are paid to the
Trust in Euros, are converted into U.S. dollars at the applicable
exchange rate and transferred from Germany to the Trust's bank
account in the U.S.  In relation to the U.S. dollar, a
stronger Euro would yield more U.S. dollars and a weaker Euro would
yield fewer U.S. dollars.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">Seasonal demand factors
affect the income from the Trust's royalty rights insofar as they
relate to energy demands and increases or decreases in prices, but
on average they are generally not material to the annual income
received under the Trust's royalty rights.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">The Trust has no means of
ensuring continued income from overriding royalty rights at their
present level or otherwise.  The Trust's consultant in Germany
provides general information to the Trust on the German and European
economies and energy markets.  This information provides a context
in which to evaluate the actions of the operating companies.  The
Trust's consultant receives reports from EMPG with respect to
current and planned drilling and exploration efforts.  However, EMPG
and the operating companies continue to limit the information flow
to that which is required by German law, and the Trust is not able
to confirm the accuracy of any of the information supplied by EMPG
or the operating companies.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">The low level of
administrative expenses of the Trust limits the effect of inflation
on costs.  Sustained price inflation would be reflected in sales
prices.  Sales prices along with sales volumes form the basis on
which the royalties paid to the Trust are computed.  </p>

<p align="left"><u>Results:&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiscal 2021 versus Fiscal
2020</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">For fiscal 2021, the Trust's
gross royalty income increased 13.64% to $4,602,410 from $4,050,017 in
fiscal 2020.  The increase in the amount of royalty income resulted in
the higher distribution.  The total distribution for fiscal 2021 was
$0.47 per unit compared to $0.32 per unit for fiscal 2020.  Gas prices
and the average exchange rates under both royalty agreements were
higher while gas sales were down.  The royalty income attributable to
gas sales under the Mobil Agreement in fiscal 2021 increased by
$195,626 as compared to fiscal 2020.  Royalty income attributable to
gas sales under the OEG Agreement in fiscal 2021 increased by $156,179
as compared to fiscal 2020. </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">As in prior years, the Trust
receives adjustments from the operating companies based on their final
calculations of royalties payable during the previous periods.  During
fiscal 2021, the adjustments based on royalties payable for 2020
decreased royalty income by $696,189.  During fiscal 2020, the
adjustments based on royalties payable for 2017, 2018 and 2019 decreased
royalty income by $653,916.  In fiscal 2021 and 2020, Mobil sulfur
royalties totaled $178,367 and $71,280, respectively.  </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">Gas sales under the Mobil
Agreement decreased 8.33% to 15.821 Billion cubic feet ("Bcf") in fiscal
2021 from 17.259 Bcf in fiscal 2020.  The most significant factor
resulting in the decrease in gas sales for 2021 was the continuing
negative impact of COVID-19 on the German, European and global economies.
In addition, according to the Trust's consultant in Germany, some portion
of the decline in gas production is due to the normal reduction in well
pressure that is experienced over time. </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">Excluding the effects of differences
in prices and average exchange rates, the combination of royalty rates on gas
sold from western Oldenburg results in an effective royalty rate approximately
seven times higher than the royalty rate on gas sold from eastern Oldenburg.
This is of particular significance to the Trust since gas sold from western
Oldenburg provides the bulk of royalties paid to the Trust.  For fiscal 2021,
the volume of gas sold from western Oldenburg accounted for only 29.33%
of the volume of all gas sales.  However, western Oldenburg gas royalties
provided approximately 79.98% or $3,326,874 out of a total of $4,159,420 in
overall Oldenburg gas royalties.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">Gas sales under the OEG Agreement
decreased 3.39% to 53.947 Bcf in fiscal 2021 from 55.841 Bcf in fiscal 2020.
The most significant factor resulting in the decrease in gas sales for 2021 was
the continuing negative impact of COVID-19 on the German, European and global
economies.  In addition, according to the Trust's consultant in Germany, some
portion of the decline in gas production is due to the normal reduction in well
pressure that is experienced over time.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">Interest income for fiscal
2021 of $641 decreased from interest income of $2,853 for fiscal

$140,013, or 18.27%, to $626,494 in fiscal 2021 from $766,507 in fiscal
2020 due to reduced Trustees' fees as specified in the provisions of
the Trust Agreement, cost savings realized through the suspension of
in-person meetings due to the pandemic, lower legal expenses, lower
insurance costs and the absence of accounting costs associated with
the biennial examinations of the royalty calculations by the German
operating companies during fiscal 2021.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">The Trust's German consultant
periodically contacts the representatives of the operating companies to
inquire about their planned and proposed drilling and geophysical work
and other general matters.  The following represents a summary of the
most recent information the Trust's German consultant received from
representatives of EMPG as of November 2021.  The Trust is not able to
confirm the accuracy of any of the information supplied by the
operating companies.  In addition, the operating companies are not
required to take any of the actions outlined and, if they change their
plans with respect to any such actions, they are not obligated to
inform the Trust.  Information on wells that are not named or are in
preliminary planning stages is not divulged by EMPG.</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<p align="left">EMPG has not planned any new wells for calendar year
2022. On the exploration side, there has been no major work initiated.
Desktop studies are continuing to satisfy mining authorities. </p>

<p align="left">The operator has performed a study, The Sour Gas Study,
dealing with all matters which could help to optimize the tail end
production from all sour gas wells in the gas fields of Oldenburg
concessions.  The focus of the study was on how to optimize the gas
compression in the flowline grids from each well to the gathering
stations, compressor stations and finally towards the processing plant
in Grossenkneten. Some optimization potential has been found.</p>

<p align="left">Grossenkneten plant operation will soon be reduced to
one train from the current two trains in parallel thus optimizing cost
and efficiency.</p>

<p align="left">It is expected that the Trust's consultant will learn
additional details about The Sour Gas Study and its impact when he meets
EMPG in March 2022.  </p>

<p align="left"><u>Critical Accounting Policies</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">The financial statements,
appearing subsequently in this Report, present financial statement
balances and financial results on a modified cash basis of accounting,
which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP basis").
Cash basis accounting is an accepted accounting method for royalty
trusts such as the Trust.  GAAP basis financial statements disclose
income as earned and expenses as incurred, without regard to receipts
or payments.  The use of GAAP would require the Trust to accrue for
expected royalty payments.  This is exceedingly difficult since the
Trust has very limited information on such payments until they are
received and cannot accurately project such amounts.  The Trust's
cash basis financial statements disclose revenue when cash is
received and expenses when cash is paid.  The one modification of
the cash basis of accounting is that the Trust accrues for
distributions to be paid to unit owners (those distributions
approved by the Trustees for the Trust).  The Trust's distributable
income represents royalty income received by the Trust during the
period plus interest income less any expenses incurred by the Trust,
all on a cash basis.  In the opinion of the Trustees, the use of the
modified cash basis provides a more meaningful presentation to unit
owners of the results of operations of the Trust and presents to the
unit owners a more accurate calculation of income and expenses for
tax reporting purposes.</p>

FIRM</p>

<p align="left">To the Board of Trustees and the Unit Owners of<br>
North European Oil Royalty Trust</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Opinion on the Financial
Statements</strong></p>

<p align="left">We have audited the accompanying statements of assets,
liabilities and trust corpus of North European Oil Royalty Trust (the
"Trust") as of October 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related statements of
revenue collected and expenses paid, undistributed earnings, and changes in
cash and cash equivalents for each of the two years in the period ended
October 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
"financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities and trust corpus
of the Trust as of October 31, 2021 and 2020, and its revenue collected and
expenses paid, undistributed earnings and changes in its cash and cash
equivalents for each of the two years in the period ended October 31, 2021,
in conformity with the modified cash basis of accounting described in
Note 1.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Basis for Opinion</strong></p>

<p align="left">These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Trust's
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.</p>

<p align="left">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Trust is not required to have,
nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.</p>

<p align="left">Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Basis of Accounting</strong></p>

<p align="left">As described in Note 1, these financial statements have been
prepared on the modified cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis
of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.</p>

<p align="center">F-1</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Critical Audit Matters</strong></p>

<p align="left">Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period
audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures
that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no
critical audit matters.</p>

ROYALTY TRUST</u></center></p>

STATEMENTS </u></center></p>

<p><center><u>OCTOBER 31, 2021 AND 2020</U></CENTER></P>

<p align="left">(1)&emsp;Summary of significant accounting
policies:</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-left:40px"><u>Basis of accounting
-</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The accompanying financial
statements of North European Oil Royalty Trust (the "Trust") are prepared
in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC.  Financial
statement balances and financial results are presented on a modified
cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting
other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States ("GAAP basis").  In the opinion of management, all adjustments
that are considered necessary for a fair presentation of these
financial statements, including adjustments of a normal, recurring
nature, have been included. </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">On a modified cash basis,
revenue is earned when cash is received and expenses are incurred when
cash is paid.  GAAP basis financial statements disclose revenue as
earned and expenses as incurred, without regard to receipts or
payments.  The modified cash basis of accounting is utilized to permit
the accrual for distributions to be paid to unit owners (those
distributions approved by the Trustees for the Trust).
The Trust's distributable income represents royalty income received by
the Trust during the period plus interest income less any expenses
incurred by the Trust, all on a cash basis.  In the opinion of the
Trustees, the use of the modified cash basis of accounting provides a
more meaningful presentation to unit owners of the results of
operations of the Trust. </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Trust receives adjustments
from the operating companies based on their final calculations of
royalties payable during the prior periods, including the immediately
preceding calendar quarter.  Negative adjustments are carried over to
the succeeding quarter.  A negative adjustment of Euros 444,931
($538,651) from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 was carried over
and offset against royalty revenue received in the first quarter
of fiscal 2021.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px"><u>Producing gas and oil
royalty rights -</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">	The rights to certain gas
and oil royalties in Germany were transferred to the Trust at their
net book value by North European Oil Company (the "Company") (see
Note 2). The net book value of the royalty rights has been reduced to
one dollar ($1) in view of the fact that the remaining net book value
of royalty rights is de minimis relative to annual royalties received
and distributed by the Trust and does not bear any meaningful
relationship to the fair value of such rights or the actual amount of
proved producing reserves. </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px"><u>Federal and state
income taxes -</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Trust, as a grantor trust
and also under a private letter ruling issued by the Internal Revenue
Service, is exempt from federal income taxes.  The Trust has no
state income tax obligations.</p>

<p align="center">F-7</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px"><u>Cash and cash equivalents -
</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">Cash and cash equivalents
are defined as amounts deposited in bank accounts and amounts invested
in certificates of deposit and U. S. Treasury bills with original
maturities generally of three months or less from the date of
purchase.  The investment options available to the Trust are limited
in accordance with specific provisions of the Trust Agreement.  As of
October 31, 2021, the uninsured amounts held in the Trust's U.S. bank
accounts were $1,147,939.  In addition, the Trust held Euros 9,942,
the equivalent of $11,498, in its German bank account at October 31,
2021.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px"><u>Net income per unit -</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">	Net income per unit is based
upon the number of units outstanding at the end of the period.  As of
October 31, 2021 and 2020, there were 9,190,590 units of beneficial
interest outstanding.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px"><u>New accounting
pronouncements - </u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Trust is not aware of
any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards that
would be expected to have a significant impact on the Trust's
financial position or results of operations. </p>

<p style="line-height:1px; height:1px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">(2)&emsp;<u>Formation of the Trust:</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Trust was formed on
September 10, 1975.  As of September 30, 1975, the Company was
liquidated and the remaining assets and liabilities of the Company,
including its royalty rights, were transferred to the Trust.  The
Trust, on behalf of the owners of beneficial interest in the Trust,
holds overriding royalty rights covering gas and oil production in
certain concessions or leases in the Federal Republic of Germany.
These rights are held under contracts with local German exploration
and development subsidiaries of ExxonMobil Corp. and the Royal
Dutch/Shell Group of Companies.  Under these contracts, the Trust
receives various percentage royalties on the proceeds of the sales of
certain products from the areas involved.  At the present time,
royalties are received for sales of gas well gas, oil well gas,
crude oil, condensate and sulfur.</p>

<p align="left">(3)&emsp;<u>Related party transactions:</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">John R. Van Kirk, the
Managing Director of the Trust, provides office services to the
Trust at cost.  For such office services, the Trust reimbursed the
Managing Director $5,613 and $4,020 in fiscal 2021 and 2020,
respectively.  </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">Lawrence A. Kobrin, a
Trustee of the Trust, is no longer a partner of the firm but
remained a Senior Counsel at Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP, which
serves as counsel to the Trust.  For legal services, the
Trust paid Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP $33,405 and $46,997 in
fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. </p>

<p style="line-height:1px; height:1px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">(4)&emsp;<u>Employee benefit plan:</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Trust has established a
savings incentive match plan for employees (SIMPLE IRA) that is
available to both employees of the Trust, one of whom is the Managing
Director.  The Trustees authorized the making of contributions by the
Trust to the accounts of employees, on a matching basis,
of up to 3% of cash compensation paid to each such employee for
the 2021 and 2020 calendar years.</p>

<p align="left"><u>Disclosure Controls and Procedures</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Trust maintains disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Trust is recorded, processed,
summarized, accumulated and communicated to its management, which
consists of the Managing Director, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure, and reported within the time periods specified in
the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.  The Managing
Director has performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of the Trust's disclosure controls and procedures as of
October 31, 2021.  Based on that evaluation, the Managing Director
concluded that the Trust's disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of October 31, 2021.</p>

<p align="left"><u>Internal Control over Financial Reporting</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">Part A.&emsp;<u>Management's
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Trust's management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule
13a-15(f)) for the Trust.  There are inherent limitations in the
effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of
human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls.
Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation.
Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of
internal control may vary over time.  Management has evaluated the
Trust's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31,
2021.  This assessment was based on criteria for effective
internal control over financial reporting described in the standards
promulgated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and in
the <i>Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)</i> issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).  Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the
Trust's internal control over financial reporting was effective as
of October 31, 2021.</P>
