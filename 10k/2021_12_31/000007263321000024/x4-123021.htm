<p align="center"><u><strong>DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES</strong></u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:50px">The following is a summary of
information concerning units of beneficial interest of North European Oil
Royalty Trust (the "<strong>Trust</strong>"). The summaries and
descriptions below do not purport to be complete statements of the
relevant provisions of the Trust Agreement ("<strong>Trust
Agreement</strong>") dated as of September 10, 1975 (as last
amended on February 13, 2008) or the Amended and Restated Trustees'
Regulations, dated as of October 31, 2007 (the "<strong>Regulations
</strong>"), and are entirely qualified by these documents.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:50px"><i>Units</i>.&nbsp;The Trust's
units of beneficial interest (the "<strong>Units</strong>") are registered
under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are listed
on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "NRT."  The issued
and outstanding Units are fully paid and non-assessable. This means the
full purchase price for the outstanding Units have been paid and the
owners of such Units will not be assessed any additional amounts for
such Units.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:50px"><i>Distributions and Reserves
</i>.&nbsp;The Trustees will, not less than quarterly, distribute and pay
to the unit owners, in proportion to their respective beneficial interest
of the Units, all rents, royalties, income, proceeds and other receipt of
or from the properties held by the Trustees ("<strong>Trust Estate
</strong>"), after payment of, or provision for, the expenses, liabilities
and obligations of the Trust Estate.  The Trustees have the right to
determine from time to time the amounts to be retained as reserves in
connection with anticipated charges or expenses of the Trust, for
contingent or unascertained liabilities or obligations of the Trust, or
for such other purpose as the Trustees may determine.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:50px"><i>Voting Rights</i>.&nbsp;Each
Unit is entitled to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of
unit owners.  Neither the Trust Agreement nor the Regulations provide for
cumulative voting in the election of the Trustees. </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:50px"><i>Other Rights</i>.&nbsp;The
Units are not subject to redemption by operation of a sinking fund or
otherwise. Unit owners are not currently entitled to pre-emptive rights.</p>
