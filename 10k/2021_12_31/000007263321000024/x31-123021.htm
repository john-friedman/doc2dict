<p align="left">I, John R. Van Kirk, certify that:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have reviewed this Annual Report on Form 10-K of North
European Oil Royalty Trust;<br />&nbsp;</li>

<li>Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to
the period covered by this report;
<br />&nbsp;</li>

<li>Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other
financial information included in this report, fairly present in all
material respects the financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented
in this report;
<br />&nbsp;</li>

<li>I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a 15(e)
and 15d 15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f)) for the
registrant and have:<br />&nbsp;</li>

<ol type="a"><li>Designed such disclosure controls and procedures,
or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under
my supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
me by others within those entities, particularly during the period
in which this report is being prepared; and
<br />&nbsp;</li>

<li>Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or
caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed
under my supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with the modified cash
basis of accounting; and
<br />&nbsp;</li>

<li>Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures and presented in this report my conclusions
about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as
of the end of the period covered by this report based on such
evaluation; and<br />&nbsp;</li>

<li>Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the
registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal
quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
control over financial reporting; and<br />&nbsp;</li></ol>

<li>I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal
control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and to
the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons
performing the equivalent functions):<br />&nbsp;</li>

<ol type="a"><li>All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information; and<br />&nbsp;</li>

<li>Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
internal control over financial reporting. </li></ol></ol>
