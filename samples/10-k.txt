                                  PART I


ITEM ONE - BUSINESS

     Aeroflex Incorporated,  through its subsidiaries (collectively,  unless the
context  requires  otherwise,  referred to as the "Company" or  "Aeroflex") is a
diversified   manufacturer  of  advanced   technology  systems  and  components,
primarily  for  government  and  defense  contractors,  and shock and  vibration
isolation  and  control  systems  for the  commercial,  industrial  and  defense
markets.  Aeroflex also provides defense  consulting  services involving systems
analysis,  design and  engineering  primarily to government  contractors and the
U.S. Armed Forces.

     Operations  are  grouped  into  two  segments:   electronics  and  isolator
products.  These  segments,  their  products  and the  markets  they  serve  are
described below.

     In March 1995,  the Company,  pursuant to a Board of Directors  resolution,
adopted a plan to consolidate its Puerto Rican manufacturing operations into its
existing  facilities  in New York and New Jersey.  The Company  intends to cease
manufacturing  operations  in Puerto  Rico by August 31,  1995 and  expects  the
consolidation to be complete by October 1995.

     As of June 30, 1995, the Company has accounted for certain segments, namely
commercial and custom envelopes  (Huxley  Envelope Corp.) and  telecommunication
systems  services  (T-CAS  Corp.)  as  discontinued  operations.  The  following
description  of the  Company's  business  does not  include  these  discontinued
operations.  These  segments  are  described  under  the  caption  "Discontinued
Operations".

Electronics
-----------

Microelectronics - ("Circuit Technology")
-----------------------------------------
     Since 1974,  the Company has been  engaged in the design,  manufacture  and
sale  of  state-of-the-art   microelectronic   assemblies  for  the  electronics
industry.  In January 1994, the Company  acquired  substantially  all of the net
operating assets of the microelectronics  division of Marconi Circuit Technology
Corporation,  which manufactures a wide variety of  microelectronic  assemblies.
This  acquisition  increased  the range of  products  offered and  enhanced  the
Company's engineering capability.

     The Company's microelectronic  assemblies are called "Hybrids" because they
combine elements of integrated  circuit and printed circuit board  technologies.
They provide many of the advantages of integrated  circuits  relative to printed
circuit  boards,  such as  miniaturization,  increased  capability  and  greater
reliability and environmental  stability.  However,  unlike integrated circuits,
they can be  economically  manufactured  in  quantities  of  hundreds to several
thousands. Hybrids are multi-layered electronic circuits,  containing very small
and barely  visible  passive and active  elements  (those that carry,  transmit,
receive,  generate or amplify signals) which are mounted and wired together on a
single multi- layered ceramic surface in patterns  designed to perform  specific
electronic functions. These functions include amplification,  switching,  signal
conversion,  voltage  regulation  and  decoding of microwave  signals.  They are
especially suited to aircraft,  spacecraft,  missile and industrial applications
where space is limited,  such as in navigation  equipment,  airborne  computers,
sonar systems, medical diagnostic instrumentation and computer instrumentation.




<PAGE>
      One such Hybrid  Microcircuit  product family,  the  MIL-STD-1553  Data
Bus product line, has a particular broad range of applications. These 
microcircuits, which have been adopted by the  Tri-services  (Army,  Navy,  
and Air Force) as a standard  interface,  act as a digital data  communication
link between various computer-based equipment.

     A series of Monolithic Data-bus  Transceivers and Remote Terminals has been
introduced  by the Company,  many of which are  described by "Standard  Military
Devices" (SMD) drawings,  thereby  facilitating  their use in current and future
avionic systems.

     The Company's  Microcircuits are used on numerous avionic systems including
the F-16 and F-18 aircraft and the AMRAAM and Tomahawk-cruise missiles. They are
also  qualified  for  possible  future use on the  updates  to older  platforms,
including F-15, F-14 and Space Shuttle. The Data-bus microcircuits are used in a
wide variety of aerospace and seaboard  navigation and communication  systems. A
Motor  Drive  Hybrid  microcircuit  has  been  qualified  for  the  AN/PVS-6,  a
miniature, eyesafe, laser rangefinder which entered production in 1993.

     The Company has production  contracts for the Serial  Interface  Module and
Current  Mode  Coupler  Module  used on the  ARINC  629  Data-bus  which  is the
commercial  equivalent of  MIL-STD-1553.  This  commercial  data  communications
interface  is used  on the  Boeing  777.

     Multichip  Modules  ("MCM's")  are a  further  advancement  of  the  hybrid
microcircuit technology, in which large digital devices such as microprocessors,
SRAM and EEPROM memories are combined with multilayer  ceramic  packages to form
complex  digital  systems or subsystems.  Multichip  modules  perform  functions
similar to hybrids,  except the emphasis is on  miniaturizing  and  synthesizing
digital functions such as microprocessor  systems and mass memories. The Company
has been qualified on several MCM designs on both the F-16 and new F-22 Advanced
Tactical Fighter (ATF). Application specific multi-chip modules have significant
market potential in avionics, workstations, telecommunications and satellites.

     The Company has expanded its standard  memory module  product line with the
addition of thirteen new memory modules.  these products,  which consist of SRAM
and Flash memory  modules,  take  advantage of the  Company's  multichip  module
expertise. They are designed to be used for a wide range of computer and general
purpose circuit board applications.

     The  Company  continues  to expand the market for the R4400  microprocessor
modules  with the sale of  evaluation  devices for several new  avionics/missile
applications.  The Intel I486 dual  microprocessor  module is being increasingly
ordered for avionics and missile applications, in production quantities.

Instrument Products - ("Comstron" and "Lintek")
----------------------------------------------
     Frequency Synthesizers and Components
     -------------------------------------

     In November 1989, the Company acquired Comstron Corporation which is now an
operating  division  of  Aeroflex  Laboratories  Incorporated,   a  wholly-owned
subsidiary  of Aeroflex.  Comstron is a leader in radio  frequency and microwave
technology used in the manufacture of fast switching frequency  synthesizers and
components.

<PAGE>                             

     A frequency synthesizer is a device or circuit that synthetically  produces
a large number of frequencies based upon a single reference frequency.  The best
way to tune a radio or  receiver  is with a crystal  frequency  reference.  When
multiple frequencies are necessary, multiple crystals and switches are required.
Eventually it becomes first  impractical,  and then  impossible,  to use a large
number of crystals due to size  constraints.  A frequency  synthesizer  replaces
millions or billions of crystals.

     The Company's  synthesizers operate in a broad frequency range of 10 MHz to
40GHz with excellent spectral purity.  Their small size and modular construction
allow for easy systems  configuration  and facilitation of repair.  The Company,
together with Hewlett  Packard,  helped develop the Modular  Measurement  System
(MMS) standard which has been selected as the architecture underlying the RF and
microwave  sections  of a number of  automated  test  equipment  (ATE)  systems,
including  CASS, the U.S.  Navy's next  generation  automated  test system.  The
synthesizers  also  significantly  improve the  performance  and  reliability of
existing radars.  The Company's  synthesizers have been selected by Westinghouse
to  upgrade  its TPS 63 and 70 series  radars.  Additionally,  the  synthesizers
improve the performance of threat  simulators as well as radar cross section and
antenna measurement systems.

     With the 1993 introduction of the new model FS-5000 synthesizer series, the
Company  strengthened  its  leadership  position  in  the  Ultra-Fast  Switching
Frequency  Synthesizer market. The FS-5000 series is ten times faster, less than
half  the  size  and  offers  superior  performance  to the  Company's  previous
synthesizers.

     Component  technology,  which contributes to the synthesizer's  exceptional
performance,  includes custom microwave and RF hybrids and filters  manufactured
by the Company.

     Radar Cross-Section and Antenna Pattern Measurement
     ---------------------------------------------------

     In January  1995,  the  Company  acquired  Lintek  Inc.  as a wholly  owned
subsidiary  of  Aeroflex.  Aeroflex  Lintek  Corp.  is a  leader  in high  speed
instrumentation radar systems and antenna measurement systems. These systems are
used by the Department of Defense and by industry.  Lintek Inc. was incorporated
in 1988 for the purpose of developing and selling instrumentation radar systems,
and  currently has systems in place with many of the large  aerospace  companies
and with major government laboratories.

     The   instrumentation   radar   systems  are  used  to  measure  the  radar
reflectivity  or Radar  Cross  Section  (RCS),  both  scale  models  and  actual
examples,  of aircraft and other objects.  These  measurements  are made in many
diverse  environments  from factory  floor,  to  laboratory,  to flight lines or
aircraft carriers.  These radar systems operate in the frequency range of 100MHz
to 100GHz.  In addition to the radar system hardware,  Aeroflex Lintek Corp. has
developed various analytical  processing and display algorithms to assist in the
interpretation of the radar data.

     Aeroflex  Lintek has three lines of radar  systems:  the Elan  series,  the
Model 5000, and the Model 4000. These systems vary in price and performance. The
Company  believes  that the Elan series radar system is the highest  performance
system in the industry,  the Model 5000 is the price performance leader, and the
Model 4000 is the low cost entry level system.

     The antenna measurement systems are used in the design and manufacturing of
all types of antennas. This product line is derived from the expertise gained in
high speed data acquisition and display techniques used in instrumentation radar
products.  These products comprise a growing  portion of Aeroflex  Lintek's 
sales due to the growth in personal  communications  and the demand for these  
systems abroad.

<PAGE>

Electronic Systems
------------------

     Building on  technology  acquired  from  Comstron,  Aeroflex  develops  and
manufactures   complex   communications  and  guidance  systems  and  subsystems
including HF, VHF and UHF receivers,  communications  jammer emulators,  weather
radar receivers, up/down converters, frequency agile radar local oscillators and
low  phase  noise  frequency  sources.  The  Company  is  participating  in  two
significant  system upgrade  programs.  It has developed a phase shifter for the
U.S. Air Force's mid-life upgrade F-16 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system
and a tunable solid state local  oscillator for the U.S. Navy MK-92 fire control
radar.

     Aeroflex  also  designs and develops  special  purpose  microprocessor  and
memory boards for severe  service  applications,  including the digital  control
unit for the  PATHFINDER  pod-mounted  night vision  system,  and a  militarized
version of Intel's  286/10  multibus  boards for the Airport  Surface  Detection
Equipment (ASDE) program.

     Since 1980,  through its  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Aeroflex Systems Corp.
("Aeroflex  Systems"),  the Company has been  supplying  analytical,  design and
engineering,  and specialized  computer  software  support  services to military
contractors  involved in major weapon  systems  programs  and to the U.S.  Armed
Forces. These services include providing personnel and specialized  expertise at
all stages of a project's design and production  related to: system  reliability
and  maintainability;   the  development  and  operation  of  systems  to  track
differences in the component  configuration of each unit built in a program; the
analysis and interpretation,  by means of specialized computer software, of test
data to assist in  modifying  a  system's  design;  the  design  and  operation,
throughout  the life of a system,  of  strategies  and programs for  maintaining
appropriate  spare parts  inventories,  planning  repair  schedules and managing
other logistical  matters;  and the training of contractor or military personnel
with regard to all these applications.

     Aeroflex  Systems  is  active  on  several  DOD  Post  Production   Support
initiatives  to  reduce  the  high  cost  of  spare  parts  and  to  enable  the
establishment of competitive  procurements  for items previously  available from
only a single  manufacturer.  Its parts Breakout Project for the Navy Department
is  one  such  program  that  will  enable  the  government  to  make  follow-on
procurements on a competitive basis.

Electro-Optics
--------------

Scanning Devices
----------------

     Since 1975, the Company has been engaged in the development and manufacture
of  electro-optical  scanning  devices used in infra-red  night vision  systems.
These  systems  detect  temperature   differences  in  the  infra-red  radiation
emanating from objects in target areas. The differences are then  electronically
amplified  and  converted to visible  light to create a visual image of the zone
being scanned,  enabling accurate  observation and weapon firing control through
smoke,  darkness and battlefield haze. The common module device  manufactured by
the Company  consists of a metal framed  module  containing  a two-sided  mirror
which,  on one side,  receives  the  infra-red  radiation  and  reflects it onto
cryogenically  cooled electronic  receptors and, on the other side, reflects the
amplified  visible  image to the  viewer.  The mirror is driven by small  torque
motors in a repetitive  motion to provide a wider scan of the target  area.  The
Company  has shipped  more than  30,000  common  module  scanner  units to date.
Applications  include the TOW anti-tank  missile systems of the M-1 Abrams tank,
the M2/M3  Bradley  Fighting  Vehicle and the AH-1 Super Cobra  helicopter,  the
Hellfire  and  the  Stinger  target  acquisition  systems  of  the  OH-58D  AHIP
helicopter,  the TADS/PNVS system of the AH64 Apache attack helicopter,  and the
LANTIRN  system which directs firing of Maverick  missiles from various  fighter
aircraft.

<PAGE>                                     

     The  Company  has  completed   development  and  has  recently  received  a
production  order for the next  generation  polygon  rotary scanner for the U.S.
Army's thermal  weapons sight (TWS),  under  contract to Hughes  Electro-Optical
Data Systems Group. TWS is a low cost,  lightweight  thermal imaging device that
detects  targets  based on  thermal  radiation  contrasts  with  background  and
utilizes a solid state thermal cooling system.  This scanner is intended for use
on standard issue U.S. Army assault rifles and crew served weapons.

     The polygon scanner  assembly  consists of a polygon mirror, a brushless DC
motor and a magnetic encoder.  Unlike scanners that oscillate a mirror,  the TWS
assembly  scans a scene by  rotating a polygon  with  twelve-mirrored  sides ten
revolutions  per second.  As each side of the  polygon  sweeps by, it produces a
continuous succession of scans.  Constant rotational speed,  synchronized to the
system's clock reference, is maintained by a phase lock servo-control loop.

     Stabilization and Tracking Devices
     ---------------------------------- 

     Since 1961,  the Company has been  engaged in the design,  development  and
production of stabilization  tracking devices and systems. These are dynamically
positioned  pedestals  on or in  moving  vehicles  such  as  trucks,  ships  and
aircraft,  upon which tracking  equipment,  such as a radar antenna, is mounted.
The  pedestal,  through  the  continuous  balancing  action  of  gyroscopes  and
servo-mechanical  stabilizers  operating  in all three  dimensions,  enables the
mounted  equipment  to remain  almost  perfectly  balanced and  motionless.  The
equipment can then automatically  track or focus on a target as accurately as if
it were on solid  ground  despite  the  motion  of the  vehicle.  The  Company's
stabilization   and  tracking   devices  are  a  part  of  major   surveillance,
reconnaissance  and weapon firing control  systems and play an important role in
high altitude  aircraft as well as in other aircraft,  ships and ground vehicles
which require precise, highly stable mounting for cameras,  antennae and lasers.
Specific  applications  include the precise mirror  pointing system for the LACE
satellite  UVPI  experiment  and the antenna  pedestal  assembly  for the AC130H
gunship aircraft.

          Magnetic Motors
          ---------------
     Magnetic motor products consist of electronically  commutated  brushless DC
motors, actuators, torque motors, solid state magnetic sensors and AC motors.

     Brushless DC motors differ from  conventional DC motors in that the current
which produces  mechanical  energy is applied to stationary coils via electronic
switches  without  physical  contact  rather than by  stationary  rods  brushing
against the  rotating  coil.  By avoiding  friction,  sparks and the wearing and
fragmenting of the brush rods, brushless DC motors provide cleaner operation and
longer  maintenance-free  life than conventional motors.  These  characteristics
make brushless DC motors  well-suited for use in vacuum situations such as outer
space  where  lubricants  needed  to  slow  brushwear   dissipate  rapidly,   in
environments  containing  volatile  or  explosive  materials  and gases,  and in
applications  where  clean  operation  is  critical.  The users of these  motors
include  major  contractors  engaged in military and  aerospace  technology  and
companies manufacturing jet engines, aircraft windshield wipers, medical and lab
equipment,  as well as cryogenic super-cooling pumps. Platforms using the motors
include the Maverick  Missile,  Space  Shuttle,  M-1 Abrams tank and the Galileo
spacecraft.  Actuators operate various mechanisms on spacecraft,  satellites and
aircraft, including the forward wing mechanism of the Beech Starship.



<PAGE>
                                     
      Torque motors are DC motors which convert  electrical current to 
mechanical force for  precisely  controlled,  usually  repetitive  movement,  
over  limited distances  and arcs less than 180  degrees.  These  motors are  
utilized in the Company's  stabilization systems and infra-red scanner modules,
as well as other applications  where  precise  movement  is  required,  such  
as for  positioning antennae, optical systems, mechanical vanes and valves.

     The Company's solid state magnetic sensors provide precise  positioning and
precise  measurement  and  control of speed in a variety of  products  including
tachometers, computer peripheral equipment and heavy industrial machines.

     The Company also  manufactures  various types of AC  electrical  mechanisms
sold either  separately or as part of assemblies such as industrial and military
fans, blowers, gear motors, induction motors, generators and tachometers.

Isolator Products
-----------------

     Since 1961,  the Company has been engaged in the  development,  manufacture
and sale of severe service shock and vibration isolation systems.  These devices
consist  of  helically-wound  steel wire rope  contained  between  rugged  metal
retainer  bars,  and are used to store  and  dissipate  potentially  destructive
vibration and shock.  The purchasers of helical  isolators are  manufacturers or
users  of  equipment  sensitive  to  shock  and  vibration  who  need to  reduce
shock/vibration  to levels  compatible  with  equipment  fragility to extend the
useful life of this equipment.  Isolators are also used to prevent vibrations in
equipment from causing  disturbances  to surrounding  equipment,  structures and
configurations. They are manufactured in a variety of materials and with special
anti-corrosion  coatings  according  to  each  customer's   specifications.   In
addition,  a line  of  isolated  systems  evolved  in  response  to  the  custom
requirements of customers. Systems capability includes integrated avionics trays
and bases, skids and pallets.

     Markets for helical  isolation  systems  include the  military,  aerospace,
geophysical  exploration,  aircraft,  communications,  transportation  and power
plants.  Specific  applications  include  sensitive mobile  equipment,  reusable
shipping containers,  shipboard electronics and navigational equipment, avionics
and other  airborne gear,  nuclear and seismic  construction,  power  generation
equipment, and heavy duty rotating and reciprocating machines.

     In October 1983,  the Company  acquired  Vibration  Mountings and Controls,
Inc.  ("VMC"),  which  manufactures  a line of  off-the-shelf  noise,  shock and
vibration  control  devices  including  a  commercial  version  of the cup mount
isolator  referred  to below.  These  rubber  and  spring  isolators,  which are
manufactured in a wide variety of sizes, strengths and configurations,  are used
primarily  in  commercial  applications  to protect  heavy  rotating  equipment,
heating,  ventilating and air  conditioning  pumps and  compressors,  and diesel
engines.  In December 1986, the Company acquired the operating assets of Korfund
Dynamics Corporation ("KDC"), a manufacturer of an industrial line of spring and
rubber shock mounts.

     A complementary line of off-the-shelf  elastomeric cupmounts was introduced
in fiscal 1991.  The cupmount is a  lightweight,  low profile  isolator which is
available in two sizes and two types of elastomer-silicone  for high temperature
applications  and neoprene where extreme high  temperature is not a factor.  The
elastomer-in-compression   design  is  particularly  effective  in  interrupting
structure borne noise transmission.  Cupmount isolators are produced and sold in
large quantities and appeal to different  segments of existing  isolator markets
and numerous industrial markets.

<PAGE>

    During  fiscal  1992,  the Company  introduced  two new series of wire rope
isolators,  the arch and the circular  arch.  The arch isolator  offers  greater
stability than the helical isolator for severe shock  applications  such as Navy
shipboard  electronic  equipment.  The circular arch was developed in a compact,
circular  configuration  to fit into smaller  space  envelopes  and compete on a
performance and cost basis with existing  competitive  proprietary  designs.  In
fiscal 1995,  the Company has  successfully  introduced the circular arch to the
industrial  market  as an  improved  solution  to shock and  vibration  problems
encountered with computers in the mobile market.

     During the last several  years,  the Company has developed and introduced a
series of new  products  to the  marketplace  to broaden the VMC and KDC product
lines.  These new  complementary  products have enabled the Company to enter new
markets,  namely, the off-highway market,  portable power market,  truck and bus
market and the seismic marketplace.

Competition
-----------

     In all phases of its continuing  operations,  the Company  competes in both
performance  and  price  with  companies  considerably  larger  than  itself  in
financial  resources and sales, and which are more diversified than the Company.
In the manufacturing of stabilization  and tracking  devices,  scanning devices,
frequency  synthesizers,  radar  cross-section  and antenna pattern  measurement
instrumentation and isolators, there are several major competitors manufacturing
similar or comparable products. In the manufacture of microelectronics, magnetic
motors and electronic systems, there are numerous nationwide, regional and local
competitors  manufacturing and distributing similar or comparable products.  The
engineering and support services  division  competes  primarily on the local and
regional levels.  The Company believes that in all of its operations it competes
favorably  in the  principal  competitive  factors of  technology,  performance,
reliability, quality, customer service and price.

     To the extent  that the  Company is engaged in  government  contracts,  its
success or  failure,  to a large  measure,  is based upon its ability to compete
successfully  for contracts and to complete  them at a profit.  Such  government
business is  necessarily  affected by many  factors  such as  variations  in the
military requirements of the government and defense budget allocations.

Government Sales
----------------
     Approximately 74% and 72% of the Company's sales from continuing operations
for fiscal 1995 and 1994,  respectively,  were to agencies of the United  States
Government  or to prime  defense  contractors  or  subcontractors  of the United
States Government.  The Company's  government contracts have been awarded either
on a bid basis or after  negotiation.  The contracts  are primarily  fixed price
contracts,  though the Company also has government  contracts providing for cost
plus fixed fee. The contracts of the Company with the United  States  Government
and prime defense contractors or subcontractors contain customary provisions for
termination at the convenience of the government  without cause. In the event of
such termination,  the Company is entitled to reimbursement for its costs and to
receive a reasonable profit, if any, on the work done prior to termination.

     Revenues  and costs on  government  contracts  are  recognized  based  upon
shipments or billings on manufacturing contracts.  Revenues and costs on certain
consulting contracts are recognized based upon costs incurred.

     In certain  product  areas,  the Company has suffered  reductions  in sales
volume due to cutbacks in the  military  budget.  In other  product  areas,  the
Company  has  experienced  increased  sales  volume  due  to  a  realignment  of
government  spending  towards  upgrading  existing systems instead of purchasing
completely new systems.  The overall effect of the cutbacks and  realignment has
not been material to the Company.

Marketing and Distribution
--------------------------
     The Company  markets  its  products  through an internal  sales force of 30
persons and over 120 sales representative  organizations  located nationwide and
worldwide.  The Company's engineers and marketing  personnel,  many of whom have
technical  backgrounds,  advise prospective  purchasers  regarding the Company's
products and how such products can be custom  designed to be  incorporated  into
specific government programs and other applications. These efforts are supported
by product  brochures  and by  published  articles and  advertisements  in trade
journals.

Product Research and Development
--------------------------------
     The Company's product development efforts primarily involve engineering and
design  relating to the  improvement  of existing  products or the adaptation of
such products to new applications. The Company's efforts also include developing
prototype  components  to bid on  specific  programs.  Several of the  Company's
executive officers and almost all of its engineers have been involved at various
times and to  varying  degrees  in these  activities.  Product  development  and
similar costs not recoverable under contractual arrangements are expensed in the
year incurred. These costs were approximately $2,389,000 and $694,000 for fiscal
1995 and 1994,  respectively.  The increased  expenditures were primarily in the
microelectronics product line, incurred to develop additional new products.

Backlog
-------
     At June 30,  1995,  the  Company's  backlog  of  orders  was  approximately
$34,681,000.  Approximately  75% was scheduled to be delivered on or before June
30, 1996.  Approximately  85% of this backlog  represents orders for military or
national defense purposes.

     At June 30,  1994,  the  Company's  backlog  of  orders  was  approximately
$40,950,000.  Approximately  83% was  scheduled to be delivered  before June 30,
1995.  Approximately  89% of this  backlog  represented  orders for  military or
national defense purposes.

Principal Materials
-------------------
     The principal materials used by the Company in manufacturing and assembling
its products are steel, aluminum,  rubber, magnetic materials,  iron and copper.
Many of the  component  parts  used by the  Company  in its  products  are  also
purchased,  including  semiconductors,  transformers,  amplifiers,  bearings and
ceramic materials.  These materials and components,  none of which are presently
in short supply, are purchased from time to time on the open market. The Company
has no long-term commitments for their purchase.

Patents and Trademarks
----------------------
     The Company owns several patents, patent licenses and trademarks. While the
Company considers that in the aggregate its patents and trademarks are important
in its operations, it does not consider that one or any group of them is of such
importance that termination could materially affect its business.


<PAGE>

Employees
---------
     As of June 30, 1995 the Company had  approximately  650 employees,  of whom
approximately  360 were engaged in a manufacturing  capacity,  and approximately
290 in clerical,  administrative,  engineering or sales positions. Approximately
240  employees  of the  Company  are  covered by various  collective  bargaining
agreements. The Company considers its employee relations to be satisfactory.

Financial Information About Industry Segments
---------------------------------------------
     The  sales  and  operating   profits  of  each  industry  segment  and  the
identifiable  assets attributable to each industry segment for each of the three
years in the  period  ended  June 30,  1995 are set forth in Note 16 of Notes to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements,   which  note  is  incorporated  herein  by
reference.

                           Discontinued Operations

     The Company has accounted for certain segments as discontinued  operations.
A description of these operations is as follows:

     Commercial and Custom Envelopes
     --------------------------------

     In November 1993, the Company sold  substantially  all of the net operating
assets of its wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Huxley Envelope Corp.  ("Huxley"),  for
$5,550,000.  Huxley is a manufacturer  of specialized  envelopes for high-volume
direct-mail  users. The loss on disposal of $2,108,000 in fiscal 1994 represents
a loss from  Huxley's  operations  of  $187,000  and a loss on its  disposal  of
$1,921,000.  The sale did not  include  Huxley's  New  York  City  manufacturing
facility which was sold in the fourth  quarter of fiscal 1995 for  approximately
$2,400,000. The sale of the facility, along with the resolution of certain other
contingencies, resulted in a net of tax gain of $240,000.

     Telecommunication Systems Services
     ----------------------------------

     Through T-CAS Corp. ("T-CAS"), a wholly-owned subsidiary which was acquired
in 1988,  the  Company  also  specialized  in the design and  implementation  of
telecommunications  and  electronic  systems  for  government,   industrial  and
commercial  customers  nationwide and abroad.  T-CAS' services  included systems
concepts and  operational  criteria,  detailed  engineering  designs,  equipment
specifications,    site   preparation,    construction,    field    engineering,
installations,  on-site training and technical assistance. The Company's plan to
discontinue this operation  included the completion of existing contracts (which
were completed at June 30, 1993) and an orderly dissolution.

     In September  1993, the Company entered into an agreement with the U.S. Air
Force  in  full  settlement  of  claims  against  the  U.S.  Air  Force  on  two
telecommunication contracts. The settlement represents a final mutual release of
all claims between the parties relative to these two contracts. In May 1995, the
Company  received  $170,000  in  settlement  of another  claim  against a former
customer. These settlements, together with other unrelated settlements of claims
and  adjustments  of previously  recorded loss  reserves,  resulted in after tax
gains of $2,295,000 and $222,000, which were included in discontinued operations
in the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  1994 and  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  1995,
respectively.

     Income from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993
reflects Huxley's income, net of tax.

ITEM TWO - PROPERTIES

     The executive  offices of the Company and the  manufacturing  facilities of
Aeroflex Laboratories  Incorporated,  a subsidiary of the Company,  occupying an
aggregate of approximately 69,000 square feet, are located in premises which the
Company owns in Plainview,  Long Island,  New York.  An  industrial  development
agency  loan  is  secured  by the  premises,  with  an  outstanding  balance  of
approximately $230,000 at June 30, 1995.

     Aeroflex Laboratories  Incorporated also leases manufacturing facilities in
Farmingdale,  Long  Island,  New York and Boca Raton,  Florida of  approximately
20,000  and  11,000  square  feet,  respectively.  The  annual  rental  of these
properties is approximately $118,000 and $72,000 respectively.

     The  manufacturing   operations  of  the  Company's  subsidiary,   Aeroflex
International,  Inc., are located in approximately  40,000 square feet of leased
premises located in Caguas West Industrial Park, Caguas,  Puerto Rico. There are
three leases,  each covering part of the premises,  expiring  through 1996.  The
annual  rentals are  approximately  $137,000.  In connection  with the Company's
restructuring  of its  operations,  it expects to have vacated these premises by
October 31, 1995.

     The Company's  subsidiary,  Aeroflex Lintek Corp.,  occupies  approximately
8,500 square feet of space in Powell,  Ohio.  This  property  contains an annual
rental of $42,000.

     The Company's  subsidiary,  Aeroflex  Systems Corp.,  leases  approximately
2,000 square feet of office space in Oxon Hill,  Maryland.  The annual rental on
this property is approximately $22,000.

     The Company's subsidiary,  Vibration Mountings and Controls, Inc., conducts
manufacturing  operations at a plant located in  Bloomingdale,  New Jersey.  The
plant, which the Company owns, consists of approximately 72,000 square feet.

     The Company  believes that its  facilities are adequate for its current and
presently foreseeable needs.

ITEM THREE - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     Filtron Co. Inc.,  ("Filtron") a subsidiary of the Company whose operations
were  discontinued  in October 1991,  was one of several  defendants  named in a
personal injury action initiated in 1994 by several plaintiffs in the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, County of Kings.

     According  to  the  allegations  of the  Amended  Verified  Complaint,  the
plaintiffs,  who are current or former  employees  of a company to whom  Filtron
sold  RFI   filters/capacitors,   and  their  wives,  are  seeking  to  recover,
respectively,  directly and  derivatively,  on diverse  theories of  negligence,
strict liability and breach of warranty,  for injuries  allegedly  suffered from
exposure to a liquid  substance or material  which  Filtron  incorporated  for a
period  of  time  in the  RFI  filters/capacitors  which  it  manufactured.  The
plaintiffs are seeking damages which cumulatively may exceed $500 million.

     Considering  its various  defenses,  together  with its  product  liability
insurance, in the opinion of management of the Company the outcome of the action
against  its  subsidiary  will  not  have a  materially  adverse  effect  on the
Company's consolidated financial statements.

ITEM SEVEN - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
             FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations

Fiscal 1995 Compared to Fiscal 1994

Net sales  increased to  $71,113,000  in fiscal 1995 from  $65,602,000 in fiscal
1994.  Income from continuing  operations for fiscal 1995 improved to $6,587,000
including  $2,000,000 of insurance  proceeds received on the death of the former
chairman  and  a  net  of  tax  restructuring   charge  of  $1,494,000  for  the
consolidation  of the  Company's  Puerto  Rican  operations  into  its  existing
domestic  facilities.   Fiscal  1994  income  from  continuing   operations  was
$5,850,000  including an income tax benefit of $1,716,000 for the recognition of
a portion of the Company's unrealized net operating loss carryforward.

Net sales in the electronics segment increased to $55,607,000 for the year ended
June 30, 1995 from  $51,585,000  for the year ended June 30, 1994 primarily as a
result of the  acquisition of the  microelectronics  division of Marconi Circuit
Technology  Corporation  in January 1994,  the  acquisition  of Lintek,  Inc. in
January  1995 and  increased  sales  volume  of  electronic  systems.  Operating
profits,  exclusive of the  restructuring  charge,  improved by  $1,788,000 as a
result of the higher sales and improved  margins,  partially offset by increased
research and development costs primarily in the microelectronics division.

Net sales in the isolator products segment increased to $15,506,000 for the year
ended June 30,  1995 from  $14,017,000  for the year ended  June 30,  1994.  The
increase is attributable to higher sales volumes in all product areas within the
segment commercial, industrial and military. Operating profits, exclusive of the
restructuring  charge,  increased  by  $220,000.  The  increase  in  volume  was
partially  offset by an unfavorable  change in the product mix and lower margins
in the military isolator division.

Cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to 66.9% from 68.9% between the
two years as a result of improved  profit  margins  primarily in the  instrument
products  division.  Selling,  general and  administrative  costs  increased  to
$15,752,000 from $14,214,000  primarily due to a $1,695,000 increase in research
and development costs.

Interest expense  increased to $1,464,000 from  $1,440,000.  Decreased levels of
borrowings were offset by increased  interest  rates.  Interest and other income
increased by $487,000 as a result of the  short-term  investments  made with the
proceeds from the 7-1/2% debentures.

The income tax  provisions  for the years ended June 30, 1995 and 1994  differed
from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to income
from continuing  operations before income taxes primarily as a result of the tax
benefits of loss carryforwards (both realized and unrealized).  In addition, the
income tax provision for the year ended June 30, 1995,  was further  impacted by
the non-taxable life insurance proceeds of $2,000,000.

Income from discontinued  operations for the year ended June 30, 1995 includes a
gain related to the sale of the former Huxley Envelope Corp. ("Huxley") building
of $240,000 and a gain related to T-CAS Corp. ("T-CAS") of $222,000. Income from
discontinued operations for the year ended June 30, 1994 was comprised of a loss
related to Huxley of $2,108,000 and a gain related to T-CAS of $2,295,000.

<PAGE>


In November 1993, the Company sold substantially all of the net operating assets
of its Huxley subsidiary.  The disposal is being accounted for as a discontinued
operation,  and, accordingly,  Huxley's operations have been reported separately
from continuing  operations.  The loss of $2,108,000 in fiscal 1994 represents a
loss  from  Huxley's  operations  of  $187,000  and a loss  on the  disposal  of
$1,921,000. The gain of $240,000 in fiscal 1995, is due primarily to a gain from
the sale of the former Huxley building.

In September 1993, the Company entered into an agreement with the U.S. Air Force
in full  settlement of claims against the U.S. Air Force for extra work,  delays
and other out-of-scope costs on two  telecommunication  contracts which were the
primary  reasons  for T-CAS' loss in 1991.  The  settlement  represents  a final
mutual  release  of all  claims  between  the  parties  relative  to  these  two
contracts.  The settlement,  together with other unrelated settlements of claims
and adjustments of previously  recorded loss reserves,  resulted in an after tax
gain of $2,295,000  which was included in  discontinued  operations in the first
quarter of fiscal 1994. The gain of $222,000 in fiscal 1995, is due primarily to
a settlement of another claim against a former customer.

Fiscal 1994 Compared to Fiscal 1993

Net sales  increased by 26% to  $65,602,000  in fiscal 1994 from  $52,031,000 in
fiscal 1993.  Income from  continuing  operations  improved to  $5,850,000  from
$1,736,000.

Net sales in the electronics segment increased to $51,585,000 for the year ended
June 30, 1994 from  $39,145,000  for the year ended June 30, 1993 primarily as a
result of increased volume of  microelectronics.  Effective January 1, 1994, the
Company  acquired the  microelectronics  division of Marconi Circuit  Technology
Corporation  ("Marconi") and, accordingly,  the net sales of the Company include
the  acquired  division  for the period  from  January 1, to June 30, 1994 which
sales were approximately  $8,300,000.  Operating profits increased by $2,245,000
in this  segment as a result of the greater  sales  volume and  increased  gross
profit margins partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative
costs.

Net sales in the isolator products segment increased to $14,017,000 for the year
ended June 30, 1994 from $12,886,000 for the previous year primarily as a result
of increased sales in the commercial and industrial  markets.  Operating profits
increased by $495,000 as a result of the  increased  sales and  increased  gross
profit   margins,   offset,   in  part,  by  increased   selling,   general  and
administrative costs.

Cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to 68.9% from 69.8% as a result
of improved profit margins in both segments. Selling, general and administrative
costs as a percentage of sales  decreased to 21.7% from 22.5% as the Company has
been able to contain such costs despite increased sales.

Interest expense decreased to $1,440,000 from $1,828,000 due to decreased levels
of borrowings. Interest and other income were lower by $95,000, primarily due to
the  lower  interest  income  as a  result  of the  sale of  certain  marketable
securities and lower interest rates.

The  income  tax  provisions  for the years  ended  June 30,  1994 and 1993 were
different from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate
to income from continuing  operations  before income taxes primarily as a result
of the tax benefits of loss  carryforwards  and the exemption of the earnings of
the Company's Puerto Rican subsidiary from U.S. Federal income taxes. The income
tax benefit for the year ended June 30,  1994  includes a benefit of  $1,716,000
relating  to  a  portion  of  the  Company's   unrealized   net  operating  loss
carryforward  recognized in accordance  with  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards  No. 109.  The income tax  provision  for the year ended June 30, 1993
also included a $150,000 charge in excess of previously  recorded provisions for
an agreed  settlement  of open U.S.  Federal  income tax for years 1986  through
1990.

Income  from  discontinued  operations  for the year  ended  June  30,  1994 was
comprised of a loss related to Huxley of $2,108,000  and a gain related to T-CAS
of $2,295,000.  Income from discontinued  operations for the year ended June 30,
1993 reflects Huxley's income, net of tax, for that period.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

June 30, 1995 Compared To June 30, 1994
---------------------------------------

The Company's  working  capital at June 30, 1995 was  $31,533,000 as compared to
$28,572,000  at June 30, 1994.  The current ratio  increased to 3.5 to 1 at June
30, 1995 from 3.3 to 1 at June 30, 1994. The increases were primarily due to the
increase in cash and cash equivalent balances to $11,330,000 from $8,238,000.

Cash provided from operating activities was $8,300,000  (including $2,000,000 of
life insurance proceeds) for the year ended June 30, 1995 and $5,477,000 for the
year ended June 30, 1994.  Cash used by investing  activities of $21,000 in 1995
was primarily for capital expenditures, which were substantially offset by funds
provided by the sale of the former  Huxley  building.  The net cash  provided by
operating  and  investing  activities  was used to  reduce  outstanding  debt by
$4,939,000 for the year ended June 30, 1995.  Cash and cash  equivalents at June
30, 1995 includes  $6,800,000  invested in commercial  paper and certificates of
deposit.

As of April 11, 1994, the Company  entered into a revised  revolving  credit and
term loan  agreement  with two banks  which is secured by  accounts  receivable,
inventory and the Company's  stockholdings in certain of its  subsidiaries.  The
agreement provides for a revolving credit line of $16,000,000,  which expires on
March 31, 1997, and a term loan of $4,000,000, which was repaid during the third
quarter of 1995. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

During June 1994, the Company  completed a sale of $10,000,000  principal amount
of 7-1/2% Senior Subordinated  Convertible  Debentures to non-U.S.  persons. The
debentures  are due June 15, 2004 subject to prior sinking fund payments of 10%,
10%, 15% and 15% of the principal  amount on September 15, 2000,  2001, 2002 and
2003,  respectively.  The debentures are convertible  into the Company's  common
stock at a price of $5-5/8 per share.

The Company  believes that  internally  generated  funds and available  lines of
credit  will  be  sufficient  for  its  working  capital  requirements,  capital
expenditure  needs,  restructuring  costs and the  servicing of its debt for the
fiscal  year  ending  June  30,  1996.  At June 30,  1995,  the  Company  had no
borrowings under its revolving credit and term loan agreement.

In November 1993, the Company disposed of its Huxley  subsidiary,  excluding its
New York City manufacturing facility, for $5,550,000. The net cash proceeds from
the sale were used to repay  indebtedness  under the  revolving  credit and term
loan  agreement.  The land and building were sold in the fourth  quarter of 1995
for approximately $2,400,000.

In January 1994,  the Company  acquired  substantially  all of the net operating
assets  of  the   microelectronics   division  of  Marconi  Circuit   Technology
Corporation for $5,650,000.  The operations acquired have been consolidated with
the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Aeroflex Laboratories,  Incorporated. The
acquired  division's net sales of  microelectronic  products were  approximately
$17,500,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 1993.

A subsidiary of the Company whose  operations were  discontinued in 1991, is one
of several  defendants  named in a personal  injury action  initiated in August,
1994,  by a group of  plaintiffs.  The  plaintiffs  are  seeking  damages  which
cumulatively may exceed $500 million. The complaint alleges, among other things,
that the plaintiffs  suffered injuries from exposure to substances  contained in
products sold by the subsidiary to one of its customers. Considering its various
defenses,  together  with its  product  liability  insurance,  in the opinion of
management of the Company, the outcome of the action against its subsidiary will
not have a materially  adverse  effect on the Company's  consolidated  financial
statements.

Management  believes that  potential  reductions  in military  spending will not
materially  affect its  operations.  In certain  product areas,  the Company has
suffered  reductions in sales volume due to cutbacks in the military budget.  In
other product areas, the Company has experienced increased sales volume due to a
realignment of government spending towards upgrading existing systems instead of
purchasing  completely  new  systems.  The overall  effect of the  cutbacks  and
realignment has not been material to the Company.

The Company's  backlog of orders at June 30, 1995 and 1994 was  $34,681,000  and
$40,950,000, respectively.

At  June  30,  1995,  the  Company  had  net  operating  loss  carryforwards  of
approximately $14,000,000 for Federal income tax purposes.

At  June  30,  1995  and  1994  the  Company  had  $1,312,000  and   $1,506,000,
respectively,  of prior years'  Puerto Rican source  earnings  held in qualified
Puerto Rican  investments  which enable the Company to take advantage of reduced
withholding  taxes to be paid when these earnings are  repatriated.  See Notes 5
and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Under present tax laws, the earnings of the Company's  Puerto Rican facility are
substantially  exempt from United States  income tax and  partially  exempt from
Puerto Rican income  taxes.  As a result of the  consolidation  of the Company's
Puerto Rican  operations into its domestic  facilities (Note 2) the Company will
no longer have this partial exemption from income taxes.

The  Company is  undergoing  routine  audits by various  taxing  authorities  of
several  of its U.S.  Federal,  state  and local  income  tax  returns  covering
different  periods  from 1991 to 1993.  Management  believes  that the  probable
outcome of these various  audits should not materially  affect the  consolidated
financial statements of the Company.

                     AEROFLEX INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Years Ended June 30, 1995, 1994 and 1993

 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Policies:

    Principles of Consolidation
    ---------------------------
    The accompanying  consolidated  financial statements include the accounts of
    Aeroflex  Incorporated  (formerly  ARX,  Inc.)  and its  subsidiaries  ("the
    Company"),  all of which are  wholly-owned.  As of June 30, 1995 the Company
    has accounted for certain  subsidiaries,  namely  telecommunication  systems
    services (T-CAS Corp.) and commercial and custom envelopes  (Huxley Envelope
    Corp.),  as  discontinued  operations.  These  subsidiaries  have  not  been
    consolidated as part of the Company's  continuing  operations  (Note 3). All
    significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

    Inventories
    ----------- 
    Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.

    Revenue and Cost Recognition on Contracts
    -----------------------------------------
    Revenue  and costs on  contracts  are  recognized  based upon  shipments  or
    billings for  manufacturing  contracts  and upon costs  incurred for certain
    engineering and support  services  contracts.  Estimated costs at completion
    are  based  upon  engineering  and  production  estimates.   Provisions  for
    estimated losses on contracts-in-process are recorded in the period in which
    such losses are first determined.

    Property, Plant and Equipment
    -----------------------------
    Property,   plant  and   equipment  is  stated  at  cost  less   accumulated
    depreciation  computed on a  straight-line  basis over the estimated  useful
    lives of the related assets.  Leasehold  improvements are amortized over the
    life of the lease or the estimated life of the asset, whichever is shorter.

    Research and Development Costs
    ------------------------------ 
    All  research and  development  costs are charged to expense as incurred and
    are classified as selling,  general and administrative  costs.  Research and
    development expenses were approximately $2,389,000,  $694,000 and $1,225,000
    during the fiscal years 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

    Intangible Assets
    -----------------
    Intangible assets are recorded at cost, less accumulated  amortization.  The
    excess of  purchase  price over the fair value of assets  acquired  is being
    amortized  on a  straight-line  basis  over a period of 40 years  except for
    certain costs  allocated to patents which are amortized  over 15 years,  the
    remaining life of the patents at the time they were acquired by the Company.
    The Company periodically  evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value
    of its intangible assets and the related  amortization  periods. The Company
    assesses  the   recoverability   of   unamortized   goodwill  based  on  the
    undiscounted projected future earnings of the related businesses. As of June
    30,  1995,  the cost in excess  of fair  value of net  assets of  businesses
    acquired   consists   substantially  of  $9,202,000   related  to  the  1989
    acquisition   of  Comstron   Corporation,   a   manufacturer   of  frequency
    synthesizers, subsystems and components.

    Invested Cash
    -------------
    Invested cash consists primarily of certificates of deposit, having original
    maturities  of greater  than  three  months,  and is carried at cost,  which
    approximates market.

    Income Per Share
    ----------------
    Income per share is  computed  based  upon the  weighted  average  number of
    common shares  outstanding  after giving  effect to the assumed  exercise of
    dilutive  stock options and warrants and, for fully  diluted  purposes,  the
    assumed conversion of debentures.

    Cash and Cash Equivalents
    -------------------------
    The Company  considers all highly liquid  investments  having  maturities of
    three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents.

    Income Taxes
    ------------

    The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No.
    109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993.  
    The effect of the change in accounting principle did not have a significant
    impact on the 1993 financial statements.  Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax 
    assets and liabilities are measured based upon the differences between the
    financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities.

    Reclassifications
    -----------------
    Reclassifications have been made to the 1994 and 1993 consolidated financial
    statements to conform to the 1995 presentation.

 2. Restructuring Charge:
    In March 1995,  the Company,  pursuant to a Board of  Directors  resolution,
    adopted a plan to consolidate its Puerto Rican manufacturing operations into
    its existing  facilities in New York and New Jersey.  The Company intends to
    cease manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico by August 31, 1995 and expects
    the  consolidation  to be complete by October 1995. In connection  with this
    restructuring,  the Company has recorded a charge to earnings of  $1,669,000
    in fiscal 1995, representing costs of abandonment of leasehold improvements,
    severance costs for  approximately 100 employees,  lease termination  costs,
    write-down of excess equipment and other related costs. This amount includes
    non-cash costs of approximately $597,000.

 3. Discontinued Operations:
    In November  1993, the Company sold  substantially  all of the net operating
    assets of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Huxley Envelope Corp. ("Huxley"), for
    $5,550,000.   Huxley  is  a  manufacturer   of  specialized   envelopes  for
    high-volume  direct-mail  users.  The sale did not include Huxley's New York
    City  manufacturing  facility which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal
    1995 for approximately $2,400,000.  The sale of the facility, along with the
    resolution of certain other contingencies,  resulted in a net of tax gain of
    $240,000.

    Effective  June 30, 1991,  the Board of Directors of the Company  approved a
    formal plan to discontinue  the operations of its  wholly-owned  subsidiary,
    T-CAS Corp.  ("T-CAS"),  which was involved in the design and implementation
    of telecommunication  and electronic systems. The plan called for completion
    of existing contracts and an orderly  dissolution.  As of June 30, 1993, all
    contracts were completed.

    In September  1993, the Company  entered into an agreement with the U.S. Air
    Force  in full  settlement  of  claims  against  the U.S.  Air  Force on two
    telecommunication  contracts.  The  settlement  represents  a  final  mutual
    release of all claims  between the parties  relative to these two contracts.
    In May 1995,  the Company  received  $170,000 in settlement of another claim
    against a former customer. These settlements,  together with other unrelated
    settlements of claims and adjustments of previously  recorded loss reserves,
    resulted in after tax gains of $2,295,000 and $222,000,  which were included
    in  discontinued  operations  in the first quarter of fiscal 1994 and fourth
    quarter of fiscal 1995, respectively.

    Huxley  and  T-CAS  have  been  reported  as  discontinued  operations  and,
    accordingly,  the Company's  equity earnings (loss) from these  subsidiaries
    and the estimated gain (loss) on disposal,  sale or discontinuance have been
    reported separately from continuing operations.

    The income from discontinued operations is as follows:

 4. Acquisition of Businesses:

    In January 1995, the Company acquired substantially all of the net operating
    assets of Lintek, Inc. ("Lintek") for $537,000 plus contingent consideration
    based on the  next  five  years'  earnings  to a  maximum  of an  additional
    $675,000.  Any  contingent  consideration  paid will be  recorded as cost in
    excess of fair value of net assets  acquired.  Lintek designs,  develops and
    manufactures radar cross section and antenna pattern measurement systems for
    commercial and military applications, as well as surface penetrating radars.
    The acquired company's net sales were approximately  $2,600,000 for the year
    ended  December 31, 1994. On a pro forma basis,  had the Lintek  acquisition
    taken  place  as of the  beginning  of the  periods  presented,  results  of
    operations for those periods would not have been materially affected.

<PAGE>

    Effective January 1, 1994, the Company acquired substantially all of the net
    operating  assets  of  the  microelectronics  division  of  Marconi  Circuit
    Technology   Corporation   ("Circuit   Tech")  for  $5,650,000  and  assumed
    liabilities  of  $3,115,000.  The purchase was financed  through  borrowings
    under  the  Company's  revolving  line of  credit  agreement.  The  acquired
    division's  net  sales  of   microelectronic   products  were  approximately
    $17,500,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 1993.

    The pro  forma  financial  information  presented  above is not  necessarily
    indicative of either the results of operations  that would have occurred had
    the acquisition  taken place at the beginning of the periods presented or of
    future operating results of the combined companies.

    The acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases and, accordingly,  the
    acquired  assets  and  liabilities  assumed  have  been  recorded  at  their
    estimated fair values at the respective dates of acquisition.  The operating
    results  of  Circuit  Tech  and  Lintek  are  included  in the  consolidated
    statements of earnings from the respective acquisition dates.

 5. Invested Cash:

    Invested cash  represents  prior years' Puerto Rican source earnings held in
    qualified  Puerto  Rican  investments  which  enables  the  Company  to take
    advantage  of reduced  withholding  taxes to be paid when the  Puerto  Rican
    source  earnings  are  repatriated.   These  funds  are  currently  invested
    primarily in certificates of deposit and become  available for  repatriation
    at the lower  withholding  tax rates  through  the year  1999.  Despite  the
    cessation of operations  in Puerto Rico,  the funds will still be maintained
    in such investments for the required statutory periods.

    (a) As of April 11, 1994, the Company  replaced a previous  agreement with a
    revised  revolving  credit and term loan  agreement  with two banks which is
    secured by accounts receivable, inventory and the Company's stockholdings in
    certain of its subsidiaries.  The Agreement  provides for a revolving credit
    line of  $16,000,000,  which  expires on March 31, 1997,  and a term loan of
    $4,000,000,  which was repaid during the third quarter of 1995. The interest
    rate on borrowings  under this agreement is at various rates  depending upon
    certain financial ratios, with the present rate substantially  equivalent to
    the prime rate (9% at June 30,  1995).  The Company  paid a facility  fee of
    $100,000,  and is required to pay a commitment  fee of 1/4% per annum of the
    average  unused  portion  of the  revolving  credit  line.  The terms of the
    agreement  require  compliance  with  certain  covenants  including  minimum
    consolidated working capital and tangible net worth,  maintenance of certain
    financial ratios,  limitations on capital expenditures and lease commitments
    and prohibition of the payment of cash dividends.

    (b) The Company has loans with a bank bearing interest at rates ranging from
    4.91% to 6.38%.  These loans  mature at various  dates  through 1999 and are
    fully collateralized by the invested cash.

    (c) The Company had a loan with a financial  institution bearing interest at
    a floating  rate of 5/8% over the prime  rate  which was  secured by certain
    machinery and equipment. The loan was fully repaid in July 1995.

    (d) The Company has several  capitalized  lease  obligations  with financial
    institutions  which have various terms through 1999 and aggregate  quarterly
    installments of $111,000.

        Aggregate long-term debt as of June 30, 1995 matures in each fiscal year
        as follows:

    ended June 30, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

10. Senior Subordinated Convertible Debentures:
    During June 1994,  the Company  completed  a sale of  $10,000,000  principal
    amount of 7-1/2%  Senior  Subordinated  Convertible  Debentures  to non-U.S.
    persons.  The debentures are due June 15, 2004 subject to prior sinking fund
    payments of 10%, 10%, 15%, and 15% of the principal  amount on September 15,
    2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. The debentures are convertible into
    the Company's  common stock at a price of $5-5/8 per share.  The Company may
    redeem  the  debentures  at a price of  107-1/2%  of the  principal  amount,
    declining by 1.5 points per year beginning June 15, 1996 to 100% at June 15,
    2000 and thereafter  except that the Company can make such redemption  prior
    to December 15, 1995 under  certain  conditions.  The net proceeds  from the
    offering were used  initially to retire  certain bank  indebtedness  and for
    general  working capital with excess proceeds placed in temporary short term
    bank related  investments.  The cost of issuing these debentures,  $947,000,
    included a 6% fee paid and 100,000 warrants, exercisable at $6.75 per share,
    issued to the placement  agent.  This amount is included in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet under the caption "Other Assets" and is being amortized over
    the term of the debentures as interest expense.

<PAGE>

    During the quarter ended December 31, 1992, the Company  completed a sale of
    $6,870,000  of  principal  amount  of  7%  Convertible  Senior  Subordinated
    Debentures.  On February 14, 1994,  the Company called for redemption all of
    the outstanding  debentures at 109% of the principal amount.  The debentures
    were  convertible  into the  Company's  common stock at a price of $2.25 per
    share.  As of March 31,  1994,  all but  $8,000 of the  principal  amount of
    debentures had been presented for  conversion,  resulting in the issuance of
    approximately  3,050,000 shares of common stock. The $8,000 was redeemed and
    the issue was retired.

11. Stockholders' Equity:

    (a)  Stock Option Plans

    Under stock option plans approved by the Company's shareholders, options may
    be granted to purchase shares of the Company's  common stock  exercisable at
    prices  equal to the fair market value on the date of grant.  The  Incentive
    Stock Option Plan,  which  expired in September  1991,  provided for options
    which become exercisable in two or three equal annual installments beginning
    one year  from the date of grant  and  expire  five  years  from the date of
    grant.  During 1990, the Company's  shareholders  approved the Non-Qualified
    Stock Option Plan which provides for options which become exercisable in one
    or more  installments  and  expire  five  years  from the date of grant.  In
    December  1993,  the Board of Directors  adopted the Outside  Director Stock
    Option Plan which  provides  for options to  non-employee  directors,  which
    become  exercisable in three installments and expire ten years from the date
    of grant. In November 1994, the shareholders approved this plan and the 1994
    Non-Qualified  Stock  Option Plan which  provides  for options  which become
    exercisable in one or more  installments and expire five years from the date
    of grant.

    Rights Plan which provided for a dividend distribution of one right for each
    share to  holders  of record of the  Company's  common  shares on August 31,
    1988. The rights will become exercisable only in the event a person or group
    accumulates  20 percent or more of the Company's  common  shares,  or if any
    person  or group  announces  an offer  which  would  result  in it owning 20
    percent or more of the common  shares.  The rights  will  expire  August 30,
    1998. Each right will entitle the holder to buy one one-hundredth of a share
    of a new  series of  Series A Junior  Participating  Preferred  Stock of the
    Company at the price of $25. In addition, upon the occurrence of a merger or
    other  business  combination,  or  the  acquisition  by a  person  or  group
    ("Acquiring Person") of 25 percent or more of the common shares,  holders of
    the rights,  other than the Acquiring  Person,  will be entitled to purchase
    either common shares of the Company or common shares of the Acquiring Person
    at half their market value.

    The Company will be entitled to redeem the rights for $0.01 per right at any
    time until the tenth day following a public  announcement of the acquisition
    of a 20 percent position in its common shares.

    In accordance with SFAS No. 109, the Company  records a valuation  allowance
    against  deferred  tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all
    of the  deferred  tax asset will not be realized.  The  valuation  allowance
    decreased  by  $2,756,000  during  fiscal 1995  primarily as a result of the
    utilization of net operating loss carryforwards.  The income tax benefit for
    the year ended June 30, 1994  includes  $1,716,000  related to a decrease in
    the valuation allowance against unrealized tax loss carryforwards,  since it
    was considered  more likely than not that such assets would be realized.  At
    June  30,  1995,  the  Company  had  net  operating  loss  carryforwards  of
    approximately  $14,000,000  for Federal  income tax  purposes  which  expire
    through 2006.

    For fiscal 1995 and prior  years,  the  earnings of Aeroflex  International,
    Inc. (the Company's Puerto Rican subsidiary) were substantially  exempt from
    United States income taxes.  These  earnings  currently  were also partially
    exempt from Puerto Rican income taxes. As a result of the  consolidation  of
    the Company's Puerto Rican operations into its domestic  facilities (Note 2)
    the Company will no longer have this partial exemption from income taxes.

<PAGE>

    The Company is undergoing  routine audits by various  taxing  authorities of
    several of its state and local income tax returns covering different periods
    from 1991 to 1993.  Management  believes that the probable  outcome of these
    various  audits  should not  materially  affect the  consolidated  financial
    statements of the Company.  The income tax provision for the year ended June
    30,  1993  included  a  $150,000  charge in excess  of  previously  recorded
    provisions  for an agreed  settlement  of open U.S.  Federal  income tax for
    years 1986 through 1990.

    The Company made income tax payments of $1,004,000,  $1,432,000 and $311,000
    and received  refunds of $16,000,  $9,000 and $30,000 during the years ended
    June 30, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

13. Employment Contracts and Life Insurance Proceeds:

    In September 1991, the former Chairman of the Company retired for reasons of
    ill health.  Pursuant to his employment contract,  the Company was obligated
    for disability benefits through 1997. Upon his death in 1995, the Company is
    required to pay a portion of these  benefits  to his widow.  The net present
    value of these amounts,  totalling $146,000 and $643,000 as of June 30, 1995
    and 1994,  respectively,  are included in other  long-term  liabilities  and
    accrued expenses.

    During fiscal 1995, the Company received $2,000,000 of insurance proceeds on
    the death of the former Chairman.

    In July 1994, the Company entered into employment agreements with certain of
    its  officers  for the period July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1999 with annual
    remuneration ranging from $200,000 to $250,000, plus additional compensation
    based upon  earnings of the Company.  Future  minimum  payments  under these
    contracts are $700,000 per year. In addition, these officers have the option
    to terminate their employment  agreements upon change in the present control
    of the Company,  as defined,  and receive  lump sum payments  equal to three
    times annual compensation, as defined.

14. Employee Benefit Plans:

    The Company has established an Employee  Stock  Ownership Plan ("the Plan")
    which  covers substantially   all  employees  not  covered  by  collective
    bargaining agreements and who meet certain service requirements.  The annual
    contribution to the Plan is determined by the Company's Board of Directors.
    For the plan years  ended  December  31,  1994,  1993 and 1992 the Board of
    Directors did not elect to make a contribution to the Plan. During 1995, the
    Company received a favorable  determination letter from the Internal Revenue
    Service for the  termination  of the Plan and intends to complete the formal
    termination of the Plan prior to December 31, 1995.

    The Aeroflex Incorporated Employees' 401(k) Plan was established pursuant to
    Section 401(k) of the Internal  Revenue Code ("the  Retirement  Plan").  All
    employees of the Company and certain  subsidiaries  who are not members of a
    collective bargaining agreement may participate in the Retirement Plan. Each
    participant   has  the  option  to  contribute  a  portion  of  his  or  her
    compensation.  For the  1995,  1994 and 1993  calendar  years,  the Board of
    Directors  has  elected to provide an  employer  contribution,  which  vests
    immediately,   equal  to  30%,  30%  and  25%,  respectively,   of  employee
    contributions  subject to certain  limitations.  The Retirement Plan expense
    for the  fiscal  years  ended  June 30,  1995,  1994 and 1993 was  $219,000,
    $160,000 and $55,000, respectively.

    Effective January 1, 1994, the Company established a Supplemental  Executive
    Retirement Plan ("the SERP") which covers certain of its officers.  The SERP
    expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995 was $347,000. As of June 30,
    1995, the Company has  contributed  $159,000 to a trust  established to fund
    its SERP liability.

15. Commitments:

    a.  Operating Leases

    Several of the  Company's  operating  facilities  and certain  machinery and
    equipment are leased under agreements  expiring through 1999. The leases for
    machinery and equipment  generally  contain  options to purchase at the then
    fair market value of the related leased assets.

    Future minimum  payments under  operating  leases as of June 30, 1995 are as
    follows for the fiscal years:

    Rental expense was $837,000,  $647,000 and $481,000  during the fiscal years
    1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

    b.  Legal Matter

    A subsidiary of the Company whose  operations were  discontinued in 1991, is
    one of several  defendants  named in a personal  injury action  initiated in
    August,  1994, by a group of plaintiffs.  The plaintiffs are seeking damages
    which  cumulatively may exceed $500 million.  The complaint  alleges,  among
    other  things,  that the  plaintiffs  suffered  injuries  from  exposure  to
    substances  contained  in  products  sold  by the  subsidiary  to one of its
    customers.  Considering  its  various  defenses,  together  with its product
    liability insurance, in the opinion of management of the Company the outcome
    of the action  against its  subsidiary  will not have a  materially  adverse
    effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

16. Business Segments:

    The Company's business segments of continuing  operations and major products
    included in each segment, are as follows:

    Electronics:                   Isolator Products:

    respectively,  were to agencies of the United States  government or to prime
    defense contractors or subcontractors of the United States government.

     The following undertakings are incorporated by reference into the Company's
Registration  Statements on Form S-8 (Registration Nos.  33-75496,  33-88868 and
33-88878).

(a)    The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:

     (1) To file,  during any period in which  offers or sales are being made, a
post-effective amendment to this registration statement:

          (i)  To  include  any  prospectus  required  by  section  10(a)(3)
of  the Securities Act of 1933;

          (ii) To reflect in the  prospectus  any facts or events  arising  
after the effective date of the registration  statement (or the most recent 
post-effective amendment  thereof)  which,  individually  or  in  the  
aggregate,  represent  a fundamental change in the information set forth in the
registration statement;

          (iii) To  include  any  material  information  with  respect to the 
plan or distribution  not  previously  disclosed  in the  registration  
statement or any material change to such information in the registration 
statement;

     Provided, however, that paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) do not apply if
the  registration  statement  is on Form S-3 or Form  S-8,  and the  information
required to be included in a  post-effective  amendment by those  paragraphs  is
contained in periodic reports filed by the registrant  pursuant to Section 13 or
Section 15(d) of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 that are  incorporated  by
reference in the registration statement.

     (2) For the purpose of determining  any liability  under the Securities Act
of  1933,  each  such  post-effective  amendment  shall  be  deemed  to be a new
registration  statement  relating to the  securities  offered  therein,  and the
offering of such  securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona
fide offering thereof.

     (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective  amendment any
of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the
offering.

          (b) The  undersigned  registrant  hereby  undertakes  that, for 
purposes of determining  any liability  under the Securities Act of 1933, each 
filing of the registrant's  annual  report  pursuant to Section  13(a) or 
Section 15(d) of the Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934  (and,  where  
applicable,  each  filing of an employee  benefit  plan's  annual  report  
pursuant  to  Section  15(d)  of  the Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934)  that 
is  incorporated  by  reference  in the registration  statement  relating to 
the  securities  offered  therein,  and the offering of such  securities at 
that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

         (f) (1) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to deliver or 
cause to be delivered with the prospectus to each employee to whom the 
prospectus is sent or given a copy of the  registrant's  annual report to 
stockholders for its last fiscal year, unless such employee  otherwise has 
received a copy of such report, in which case the registrant shall state in the
prospectus that it will promptly furnish,  without  charge,  a copy of such  
report  on  written  request  of the employee.  If the last fiscal year of the 
registrant  has ended within 120 days prior to the use of the prospectus,  the 
annual report of the registrant for the preceding  fiscal year may be so  
delivered,  but within such 120 day period the annual report for the last 
fiscal year will be furnished to each such employee.

<PAGE> 

             (2) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to transmit or 
cause to be transmitted  to all  employees  participating  in the plan who do 
not  otherwise receive such material as stockholders of the registrant,  at the
time and in the manner such material is sent to its stockholders,  copies of 
all reports,  proxy statements and other communications distributed to its 
stockholders generally.

            (3) Where  interests in a plan are  registered  herewith,  the  
undersigned registrant  and plan hereby  undertake  to  transmit or cause to 
be  transmitted without charge,  to any participant in the plan who makes a 
written  request,  a copy of the then latest annual report of the plan who 
makes a written request, a copy of the then latest annual  report of the plan 
filed  pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 
(Form 11-K). If such report is filed separately on Form 11-K, such form shall 
be delivered upon written  request.  If such report is filed as a part of the  
registrant's  annual report on Form 10-K, that entire report (excluding 
exhibits) shall be delivered upon written request.  If  such  report  is  filed
as a part  of the  registrant's  annual  report  to stockholders  delivered  
pursuant to paragraph  (1) or (2) of this  undertaking, additional delivery 
shall not be required.

          (4) If the  registrant is a foreign  private  issuer,  eligible to use
Form 20-F,  then the registrant  shall  undertake to deliver or cause to be 
delivered with the  prospectus to each employee to whom the prospectus is sent 
or given, a copy of the registrant's latest filing on Form 20-F in lieu of the 
annual report to stockholders.
  
             (i) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the 
Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors,  officers and controlling
persons of the  registrant  pursuant  to  the  foregoing  provisions,   or  
otherwise,  the registrant  has been advised that in the opinion of the  
Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public 
policy as expressed in the act and is, therefore,  unenforceable. In the event
that a claim for indemnification against such  liabilities  (other than the 
payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director,  officer 
or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action,
suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director,  officer or controlling person
in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless 
in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been  settled by  controlling  
precedent,  submit to a court of  appropriate jurisdiction the question whether 
such  indemnification  by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act 
and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

equivalent shares  outstanding,  the sum of the quarterly per share amounts does
not necessarily equal the per share amounts for each year.
